                "comentario": "Not true. Helicopters are much safer then fixed wing aircraft when it comes to emergencies, if operated by a well trained pilot. As an air traffic controller, Ive personally had 2 helicopters in my short career that Ive been talking to declare an emergency and walk away without safe to the aircraft. This is due to a procedure called autorotation. An autorotation is a recovery maneuver where the pilot can force a short, brief rotation of the rotor causing a surge of lift. In one of my examples, a helicopter rapidly lost oil pressure and declared an emergency and aimed to set down in a field. Thanks to the autorotation, he was able to safely but roughly land the aircraft with no injuries. He even flew it out less then 3 hours later after preforming an oil change. Now, if that had been a fixed wing aircraft I would be discussing a tragedy. Where that pilot landed was nothing but sheer sea cliffs and dirt roads. His only option would be an attempted sea landing which often times proves fatal. Helicopter pilots practice autorotations relentlessly at my former airport, and watching autorotations was always so cool. You see the helicopter nose down and speed towards the ground only at the last second to recover and avoid the ground. Id fly in a helicopter over an airplane any day of the week.",

The question we need to be asking is how long does this indefinite suspension need to last before they just cancel entirely. A month would put the playoffs and draft at the beginning of July and end of July. 2 months and you are talking about August and end of August. When does it reach the point of interfering with the next season. The events of the next two weeks are going to be the telling sign here.

Lebron is not willing to make a statement against Chinas crackdown on Hong Kong because it is a high cost to him. The NBA is a black league, so him showing support for Black Lives Matter, MLK, and setting up a Charter school is a low risk political stance. But when it comes to Free speech and China, he cant muster the courage to take the financial hit but stand on his principles that a government should be afraid, and responsive, to its people and not the other way around. He deflected and refused to make a statement. He sold out to protect his business interests. Thats his right, and freedom, to do so in this country.

But the same is true for most people and their respective countries. While we acknowledge the complexities of these issues, there is enough information readily available for a reasonable person to make an informed decision on which side is on the side of what is right.

        "description": "Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rockets dismal performance in Miami last week, and the citys reputation for high quality titshacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Hardens vice affects his game. So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope yall enjoy! Hypothesis James Hardens box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs Test Analyze James Hardens performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship. x200B MethodologySteps  First I extracted all of James Hardens game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit a bunch, and appended it into a single worksheet.  Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.  Poor Performances were determined by variances in 6 stats Points, FG, 3PT, FT, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Hardens overall season average to the cityspecific season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances 1. SubPar  Harden performed WORSE than season average, and 2. Very SubPar  Harden performed 20 WORSE than season average.  I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBAs 28 different cities did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC  28 cities.  City Strip Club Rating was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search CITY Strip Clubs e.g., Detroit Strip clubs. Yes, this did involve me making like 30 searches for strip clubs on my cpu...  Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts. x200B Conclusion !I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Hardens game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. ! !Correlation Coefficient  r  between avg strip club rating and total  of subpar games  .4575!  !Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderatetostrong correlation. ! !Coefficient of Determination  r2  between avg strip club rating and total  of subpar games  .21!  !This means that James Hardens box score is 20 predictable based on the quality of a citys strip clubs ! !Other interesting facts !  !Hardens best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs  Toronto!  !Hardens worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs  Miami!  !Salt Lake city has the 3rdranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol! x200B Link to all my work The charts wont upload perfectly to google docs so I have included screenshots here x200B e. haha well this blew up. Just wanted to take the opportunity to say how much I appreciate rNBA for being the best fucking sub on this site despite yall nephews calling my boy hitler, thanks to all my fellow redditors for the nice words and the ridiculous amount of gold.",

And was gonna joke about how theres no section in the NBA Rule Book that covers the contingency of a player trying to stay on the court despite having shat himself. But then I remembered they have rules for openbloody wounds and I guess theyd apply those stop play and give team 30 seconds to remediate, and if problem cannot be solved within those 30 seconds, the team can either call a timeout for more time to handle it, or substitute a player. And if they make a substitution, opposing team is also allowed to make a substitution. So the NBA has shitty drawers covered, after all.",

It was Christmas of 2015 and the spirits were high, She went to her bros room to chat with the guys. She stood in the doorway, just talking away, The brothers, in bed, told jokes from the day. The jokes had them laughing and crying with glee, More laughter would build with each joke or story. They love potty humor, but keep it light hearted.... So to be funny the sister pretended she farted. She turned around put her finger to her lip, Sticks out her butt and lets a little one rip.... And here is where the story takes a twist, Because out of her butt came not a fart but a kiss. That little piece of chocolate plopped to the floor, Right between her feet, while she stood in the door. She looked down in horror, like a rat in a trap, In front of her brothers shed taken a crap. She looked up in terror, and then her face blushed, Shed crapped out a memory that couldnt be flushed The brothers were rolling with laughter and tears, Everyone knew this was her sum of all fears. The snicker from her knickers drew snickers from all, As she stood, feet curled round her mess in the hall. The heartfelt fartdealt turned shartpelt of lore, Was birthed right there on their cabins new floor. She pleaded and begged that my friends never tell, Of her personal nightmare from her bowels of hell. They gave her their word, not a whisper or shout, That unlike her brownie, this would never come out. But now it is time for an important edit Never poop in front of your brother with Reddit.",

Pinky didnt make it through the process unscathed. However, this tech was oblivious. As they continued to reach for more and more toilet paper to reduce the muddy mess, they didnt notice that pinky was spreading evidence of his demise on the roll each time they grabbed a new piece.

I dont think he was illintentioned with it, but definitely could see how people thought he was.",

All of this on land that was being taken from indigenous people as they were systematically murdered and displaced. Until we start to realize these truths, our country cannot fully heal and offer equity to the people it exploits the most. Trump is just the latest symptom of the disease that is America. Can we reclaim it and make it a place for everyone to live freely and prosper? Certainly.

I know Jordans shot I remember watching it live. I know people have hit game winners as time expired before. I know Dame himself did it to send Houston home in the playoffs 5 years ago. He did that one coming off a screen as a rhythm catch and shoot on a set play with no real choicebarely any time left. This dude jus consciously decided to make this shot happen this way this time.

        "description": "MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES SCOREKEEPER POSTING FRAUDULENT NUMBERS FOR DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR LEADER JAREN JACKSON JR. I would like to bring to your attention the scorekeeper of the Memphis Grizzlies. I was wondering how a solid defensive player can suddenly have some specific statistical categories that are completely off the charts. I am referring to Jaren Jackson Jr., who, after having missed 16 games to start the season due to offseason foot surgery immediately started having extreme outlier high steals  blocks statistics, leading the entire NBA in blocks per game by a wide margin. In fewer minutes per game than other players Jaron Jackson repeatedly gets outlandish block numbers at home. I decided to take a closer look at his games and IMMEDIATELY 1 thing became crystal clear. At home in Memphis he has 66 blocks in 16 home games, averaging 4.13 blocks per game, versus just 35 in 16 road games, averaging 2.19 in nearly identical minutes an 89 increase in Memphis. In home games he has been credited with 22 steals in 16 home games, versus only 10 steals in 16 road games. This means he is averaging nearly 1.4 steals per game at home, but just 0.63 steals on the road per game an astounding 120 increase in Memphis. In home games he has been credited with 88 blocks  steals, versus 45 on the road. This equates to an average of an outlandish 5.5 blockssteals at home in limited minutes versus a reasonable and realistic, and still outstanding, 2.81 stealsblocks per game on the road. This equates to a 1.96X home stat increase only in these 2 categories. A 96 increase in performance specifically at home is truly an aberration which should be reviewed. This demonstrates the sort of incredulous statistics which calls for serious analysis. Just 3 out of his 14 games this season with 5 blockssteals have come on the road. 8 out of 9 of his 6 stealsblocks games have been recorded in Memphis. I decided to watch 2 memphis grizzlies games where he had one of his ludicrous 8 blockssteals games. By my count he actually had 3 fewer stockssome people refer to stealsblocks as stocks than he was credited for by the home scorekeeper. I wonder if the scorekeeper has some sort of vested interest in Jaren Jackson getting maximum high value defensive statistics that he thinks he can get away with putting down into the box score. Jaren Jackson in July  mid November started as high as 10,000 for DPOY at certain sportsbooks after the Grizzlies announced he had undergone a procedure to address a stress fracture in his right foot and would be sidelined for 46 months. Now, in large part thanks to these blatantly wrong statistics, he is a huge odds on favorite at higher than 200. I conducted some analysis on all 78 games jaren jackson played last season... my hypothesis was that his homeroad difference on steals  blocks would both be small. He had 90 blocks in Memphis and 87 blocks on the road. He had 39 steals in Memphis and 34 steals on the road. He had 129 stocks in Memphis vs. 121 stocks on the road. BPG was actually 12.7 lower on the roadhe played 4 fewer home games while stealsblocksgame was 15 lower on the road higher than i expected, but reasonable given all the differences for Memphis when playing at home vs on the road, from their homeaway record difference to crowd noise to effortenergyintensity exerted by players, etc. 90 higher in Memphis, however, as is the case this season, is NOT REASONABLE AND COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC. My educated guess is that the Memphis scorekeepers have been changed since last season andor ULTERIOR MOTIVES, INCENTIVES are now in play with respect to JJJs defensive statistics. Why is this happening so blatantly to the point where a person can just look at Jaren Jackson Jrs. stealsblocks s on the box score and determine with a high level of confidence whether that game was played on the road or in Memphis is the next question... Three potential explanations, only one of which is innocent 1. Jaren Jackson plays MUCH MUCH MUCH harder at home and hustles like a maniac and focuses on stealing and blocking shots like crazy in Memphis, causing his numbers to be skewed in an absurd manner even compared to his regular highly efficient top 3 but realistic, road numbers. This can almost certainly be discounted because i looked at his other statistics and everything from his minutes per game to points per game to rebounds per game and even fouls are close in terms of homeaway splits. 2. The Memphis scorekeeper is a huge Jaren Jackson Jr. fan and is purposely imbellishing his steals  blocks, since that is much easier to do than points or rebounds, for instance. When he contests a shot well, but does not touch the ball, perhaps the scorekeeper purposely gives him the undeserved stat and donates blocks to him where none occurred, for instance. 3. It should also be investigated in this age of fantasy basketball and gambling on sports whether this scorekeeper andor his family and friends bet on Jaren Jackson to win the defensive player of the year award at super long odds and as a result has a tremendous financial incentive to juice and fake a players 2 most valuable defensive statistics BLOCKS and STEALS, which are also the easiest to fudge s on because it is often most difficult to definitively label steals and blocks without slow motion on at least some of the plays in question. I and all NBA fans would appreciate a thorough investigation into this matter. It is important to have 100 integrity in statistics not only for things such as fantasy sports, sportsbetting, futures wagers, but even more importantly to ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME FOR ALL. This is mandatory to be able to compare players statistics versus other players now in the league fairly as well as across seasons and know the numbers are accurate, correct, and not unfairly manipulated by home arena scorekeepers. I decided to watch just a few of the Grizzlies recent games and immediately started noticing a pattern Plays at FedEx arena in Memphis constantly being scored wrongly to gift Jackson extra steals and blocks which never occurred. Simply put, if a shot does not hit the rim or it otherwise looks bad somehow, and Jaren Jackson is either contesting the shot or close to the action, he is credited with FRAUDULENT blocks repeatedly. Sometimes this is achieved by taking away the stat from his teammates. Other times, an opposing player simply loses the ball or shoots a contested shot way off target, but Jackson nevertheless is credited with steals  blocks that never occurred in both instances. Also, when he deflects a ball and it goes to a teammate he is credited with the steal. When his teammate deflects the ball and it goes to him he is STILL credited with the steal IN MEMPHIS. When he tips or deflects a ball, but never gains possession nor do the Grizzlies, he is still awarded a steal. The following is just a very small  of questionable or outright WRONG steals and blocks given to Jackson Example 1 New Orleans Pelicans  Memphis Grizzlies Saturday 1231 7mins, 21 sec remaining in the 2nd quarter Zion drives to the basket, NEVER shoots the ball, and loses it. Williamson in a crowd, ball pops free, picked up by Tyus Jones, turnover number 9 by the pelicans announcers say. Scorekeeper in Memphis graded the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. blocks Zion Williamsons 3foot driving layup Example 2 Utah Jazz  Memphis Grizzlies Sunday 18 1009 remaining in the 1st quarter Jordan Clarkson throws a bad pass directly to Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson for some odd reason is credited with the steal. Bane actually steals the ball. Example 3 Utah Jazz  Memphis Grizzlies Sunday 18 146 remaining in the 4th quarter Kelly Olynyk loses the ball while being defended by Xavier Tillman. The ball then bounces off Tillman and Jaren Jackson before being picked up by Tillman. The steal should be credited to Tillman. Memphis scorekeeper grades the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. steals Example 4 Phoenix Suns  Memphis Grizzlies Monday 116 702 remaining in the 4th quarter Brandon Clarke blocks Saban Lees layup, but the Memphis scorekeeper instantly gives the block to nearby Jaren Jackson Jr. Example 5 Cleveland Cavaliers  Memphis Grizzlies Wednesday 118 1148 remaining in the 2nd quarter Lamar Stevens, who Jaren Jackson helps on, loses the ball and Desmond Bane picks it up and gains possession. The Memphis scorekeeper gave steal to Jaren Jackson. Example 6 Detroit Pistons  Memphis Grizzlies Friday, December 9th 39 seconds remaining in the 2nd quarter Jackson deflects a pass and never gains possession, saved back to Detroit player. Memphis scorekeeper gives a steal to Jackson. Example 7 Oklahoma City Thunder  Memphis Grizzlies Wednesday, December 7th 1038 4th quarter Jackson saves out of bounds ball directly to Thunder player underneath basket for quick score, but gets credited with a steal. Thank you very much for reading this. I would appreciate well thought out responses, a good discussion, and also advice on how someone in charge at the NBA can investigate these plays as well as others from Grizzlies games, and the dishonest Memphis scorekeeper. Also, can obviously fraudulent statistics be deleted, corrected  reversed weeksmonths later?",

        "description": "Effective immediately, rnba will be banning links to TwitterX, as well as other social media platforms that require logins for their content to be browsed, including Facebook, Instagram and Threads. We have reached this decision after taking recent events and strong sentiment from our community into account. While we try our best to stay neutral and apolitical, we do not believe taking a stance against Nazi symbolism is or should be a political issue. Hate speech and the promotion of it has never been tolerated in our community. In addition, our users have brought forth issues regarding Twitter and other social platforms like it, ranging from accessibility, to content quality, to concerns over data privacy. Since the change in ownership, Twitter has also seen a significant rise in spam and xrated content. Below, we will provide further context for how we came to this decision and how we will operate going forward. Additionally, we will be monitoring the situation for the next 30 days to gauge user experience and feedback on the impact to the subreddit and solicit further feedback, and implement any changes at that time. Please feel free to provide any feedback or opinions on the matter. Thank you ___ Why do this now? In the end, there were three key elements in making this decision  An increase in hate speech and discriminatory language, both on Twitter overall and coming directly from the owner of the platform.  A litany of functionality, usability and content quality issues that have existed for a while.  Considering the sentiment of our users. We tried to consider any and all factors and felt this was the clearest path forward at this juncture. Why not permit screenshots of Tweets? This was something we went back and forth on but decided it was not a can of worms we wanted to open right now but would monitor as an option down the road. While screenshots are an easy alternative to posting direct links, there are a few reasons why we want to go without screenshots first  The biggest concern with screenshots is that they are much more difficult to verify as legitimate.  Screenshots are not accessibilityfriendly for screen readers.  If we are banning Twitter and other major platforms, we do not want to take half measures.  Reddit and rnba are a significant factor in the internet content ecosystem. We believe that if reddit traffic is not supporting platforms like Twitter in any way, that journalists and content creators in the space will be encouraged to move to alternative platforms that dont compromise their users and offer better accessibility for content. Is this censorship of content? Ensuring that we were not limiting or censoring content was one of the primary points of discussion for us. We do not believe that this handicaps or censors content because we are not putting a restriction on specific content or subject matter. We believe that any notable story that takes place in the NBA environment will still find its way to our subreddit through other avenues that are still permitted. So where do we go from here? While we are not endorsing any specific platform, the platform we have seen suggested most from our users and one where we believe a significant contingent of NBA reporters have already made their way over to is BlueSky. ESPN reporters are also beginning to use notifications from the ESPN app. Thank you again and please feel free to provide feedback on these new rules!",

First, its based on a smear campaign that even the AntiDefamation League  the authority on Nazism and antisemitism  says is hysterical and misleading. The Prime Minister of Israel released a statement saying Elon Musk doesnt have an antisemitic bone in his body. So, the entire premise of this silly move is based on a lie. Second, its in service of partisan politics, something that should have no place in this sub. We all know this is motivated by Musks association with Trump. You can pretend its unrelated but it obviously isnt. Third, it will have a massively negative effect on the subs ability to share content. The fact that you even banned screenshots shows youre deliberately degrading the experience of the sub in order to achieve political ends. Mods have a duty to protect the sub from political nonsense and ensure a positive experience. This does the opposite.",

Yes again I get it looked bad, but the guy who is actively trying to get us to Mars and works on other space programs, is secretly some racist, white supremest, what does he have to gain by doing a Nazi salute? It was a mistake he obviously made. I wish he would just apologize and say he didnt mean it and he knows he upset some people and he acknowledges his mistake. But at the end of day he doesnt have to explain himself to idiots that actually think hes supporting Nazism. He made a mistake why cant it just be left at that. Not even trying to defend the man.

Niches on the platform first get modded by users that form those communities but they do it for free as a passion project. They dont get equity in this growth. All they get is the shitstorm. So the company mass hires wage earners with no equity to try to clean up the toxic shit building up. Meanwhile, the corporate suits are seeing all this growth and they want the site to add an extra revenue stream. But to make users love it, theyll add new functions to the site. Adding those features creates more bugs, more labor, more shitstorms. Eventually, some content on the platform goes viral for showing unethical content. And thats only then when corporate suits put real money into moderation, because the pr costs them money. Matter fact, he may have mentioned reddit as an example.",

If ever there was a chance for him to stay, he needs to make a deep run this season and really grow with the team. Maybe thats not enough at the end of the day. Maybe he will leave. But if they go far enough. If they play for a championship, maybe he stays. Why go back west to be third or fourth, when you can be King or the East? Just my two cents",

But then I found out that Im out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But Im really a shy person so I took up a threeyear personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, Im a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her shell be fine and I wished her well. I still think shes the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really cant sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally cant take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where shes sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked whats up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching the Raptors game and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to see how the game ended. She said, you know what, Ive been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, theres my phone and this game still has a couple more bounces on it.",

I dont think OKC in this case care and a young talented team gets to play during this historic moment and they can tell their kids that they played Lebron during this game, and won.",

To be good enough to break the record is only part of it. You also need the longevity and ridiculous luck to avoid any injuries. KD basically missed around 4000 points because of his injuries. That type of set back is basically impossible to recover from. LeBron just has it all. The longevity. The talent.

It was pouring rain and he had a migraine but he still signed a bunch of cards for my students and stood in the rain after we got off the boat and fist bumped every kid in my class of about 50 or so then after, walked through the streets high fiving people who noticed him including a very excited truck driver I only got to say a few words to him Me its an honor to meet you KAJ are you their teacher? Me ya. KAJ well, than its an honor to meet you. Not as good as an airplane reference, but pretty damn close Stand up guy who is truly a gentle giant EDIT sorry for the spacing, on mobile and dont know how to work the damn thing",

And then those new members make friends in the group and they have a good time, they feel special. And slowly, very slowly, the group starts to introduce them to more crazy ideas, and the new members are pressured by their friends to subscribe to it, or else they see their friends who disagree being ostracised and they dont want that to happen to them. Those are ostracised are often treated even harsher than those the group supports hate towards. It happens in every hate group, and NOI is no exception.

I feel bad for people who truly cannot get the shot or cannot create antibodies. My heart goes out to them. I hope they can ride out this pandemic safely.

Id argue that the get vaxxed message has been nice, and has been informative. Theyve made easy to use websites, doesnt cost you money, gave you options as far as the eye can see in where and how you want to get the shots. Doctors, politicians, celebrities, and survivors have all been very vocal and outgoing with the message of please get the vaccine. There has been more than sufficient evidence to support that the vaccine is safe. So trust me when I say, The nice way has been, and continues to be used. Maybe some people are just sick of trying to convince these adults to finally do the right thing. Maybe their frustration is more real then the oppositions fear",

They claim to be the party of fiscal responsibility, yet for decades they have actively tried to bankrupt us with voodoo economics and policies that transfer more and more wealth from the lower and middle class to the rich. They claim to back law and order, but January 6th showed us how they really feel about that. They claim to be the party of family values, yet they fullheartedly support a man on his third marriage to an eastern bloc trophy wife that he cheated on while pregnant by raw dogging porn stars, that openly brags about wanting to fuck his own daughter, that has been accused of sexual misconduct or assault by over 20 women and those are just the ones willing to step forward. There is no principle left. The only leg they have left to stand on is identity politics. Try this little experiment. Go to rConservative and count how many of the top 20 posts on the front page are about actual policy. How many of those posts are about real problems facing real people and how conservatism can fix them, and how many are bullshit social media reposts about trans athletes or woke actors or something some liberal politician said out of context. Most of us realized a long time ago Republicans dont have solutions, and most of what they do actively makes shit worse.

Everyone not named Reaves and stanley johnson displayed either a lackluster effort, stupid decision making on a regular basis, andor occasional complete noneffort on defense. You guys make millions. At least try....I can live with the rest. Sadly, loyal Laker fans continued to suffer through it all while being shortchanged. So, personally, after a while, I enjoyed watching them get blasted over and over. Blow it up. Bring back van exel, ceballos, divac, threatt, and eddie jones.",

There, on a bed, connected to a life support device is what appears to be the shrivelled up remains of a human, face gaunt and muscles atrophied, skin stretched tight over bones. LeBron approaches the figure, in the darkness, illuminating himself as he steps under the fading light of the room. He looks at the corpse whos lips struggled to form words he says I didnt sign up for this, LeBron. LeBron chuckles as he connects a wire to a socket under his armband and the machine keeping this husk of a body alive spins up fluids begin to flow into LeBron as he smiles, feeling the energy flow inside of him. Of course you signed up for this Kendrick Nunn.",

Curry still doesnt know what its like to be lebron and carry a team anywhere. Mvp my ass.   LeBron carried worthless cavs teams to the finals in his younger days. Curry cant even lock an 8th seed  Curry is not better than Harden or LeBron. Least they can carry a bum squad to the playoffs. He is not an MVP this season either. Thank you Memphis for your work.",

Other possibility is LeBron wanted to do this as soon as possible so he could facilitate recruiting playerspushing the Lakers to make trades. Lot easier to get veterans to want to come for you for the minimum now at the beginning of FA than if you wait till most of them have already signed lol Also the fact this is 4 years when LeBron has just done a ton of 12 year deals in the past is v interesting. Shows you how little faith he had in Dan Gilbert to pay that absurd tax bill otherwise unless he held leverage of potentially leaving. Because hes not doing that here. If there isnt already a big deal in place hes also clearly willing to trust LALs FO that they will be willing to trade some of those young players for win now help and spend as much as it takes. Theres a clear level of trust here that was never shown in Cleveland to that organization",
