Leicester City winning the league isn't something that I ever thought would happen and even though I don't support any of the related teams, I couldn't help but be invested in this journey. Feeling the tension of the title race, laughing at all the memes and banter, and re-learning about the football landscape has been truly wonderful. It's made me remember all the good times, like playing shirts vs. skins in the park, or going around to my rich uncles house to watch Leeds choke in the Champions League (because back then us working class didn't have good TV), and any number of other things. And this has honestly made me a fan of football again, something I never thought I'd say any time soon. Obviously there's the jokes about plastic fans, but I feel this season has truly made a ton more fans for football. It's been a great journey lads. I'll see you all again next year.",

Many of those in the US who were anti-slavery/pro-civil rights weren't exactly opposed to the idea of a superior race. And those who were against those ideas may have championed against them simply for political advantage. There were plenty of genuine people of influence in the US of course, but at the political level it often boiled down to who could get the advantage in their district. But I digress, Wilson is a special case because he campaigned on fairness and equality, but after he was elected he screened *Birth of a Nation* at the White House, instituted segregation in the White House, and advanced pro-confederate propaganda. >People here generally don't rate US presidents based on their domestic policies Yeah of course, that makes sense. I just found it amusing that he's not controversial somewhere out there. I've been witness to many a argument about Wilson over my career in history.",

The likelihood is that you'll hit the standing one 100 times unless you completely fuck up and trip on the ball, with a volley the air, I can assur you you'll miss at least 1, and scuff about 20%.

EDIT not to mention his completely myopic and shortsighted handling of the messi situation last summer. he could've sold messi for 100m and saved more than 100m on messi's salary, but machismo got the best of him and he forced messi to stay, thus missing out on a potential 200m swing that could've helped the club climb out of debt. you could see this coming from a mile away last summer.",

It's just that the gap in level between us and this Real is greater than people appreciate. I actually don't think I've ever seen a team as dominant as that Real under Zidane. While Pep's barça was great and the most enjoyable to watch, this Real team is as strong in the back as it is lethal in the forefront. I mean, look at Ramos' game, it's not even fair",

I do realize that men in general are seen as the chasers of sex, and the women as providers. And I totally get that part. I'm talking more about people viewing relationships this way. I get that in general, that's how it is, but once you are in a relationship, it just seems extremely unrelateable to me that you'd have to work for it like a dog for a bone. That's the whole point of a relationship, finding your match and partner. Once you are in that relationship, the whole dynamic should be balanced. And yet I keep seeing this sentiment in every single sitcom, tv show, movie, and yes even comments on forums like this. It's also just this common joke people refer to in conversations and social settings, with pretty much no common counterpart to balance the scales. It just feels really weird. Like everyone just accepts this extremely odd thing. So I just don't get if I'm the anomaly, or if the majority of people are actually in relationships where the guy chases sex forever like some sort of prize. I get jokes, I get that we exaggerate sometimes for comedic effect. But this specific thing is so overused, while never being called out, I feel like I'm the odd man out who thinks it's NOT normal to be in a relationship where the man has to work for the sex. Sure sometimes the man has a higher libido, sometimes the woman has. But the notion that in general the woman \"throws the man a bone\" horrifies me.",

If I'd have to earn it like this and feel like I've been given a \"prize\" I'd be completely shocked. Is it a thing in some cultures? Maybe in the US? (I'm not American sorry). Edit: I'm not talking about comments like this about people who weren't already in a relationship. That's legitimate and funny. I'm talking about the concept, or at least feeling I get, that sex is some holy grail thing that you have to earn in relationships for some.

He had everything he needed to be happy, to be the best, yet he always took a wrong turn and ended up badly, but not without having touched greatness moments before. Maradona was Argentina.

That's a very basic description. Lots of it is down to genetic luck, practice and lots of it is having psychological fortitude to build on raw biological ability and continued development of an acquired skill.

The news covered will generally be found at other sites instead. This ban is not related to the quality and reliability of content from The Sun, and we are not looking to ban any sources based on those criteria.

Imo Inter have the best manager but weakest (at least for the moment, we'll see how well Conte can get Lukaku playing, etc.) squad. Dortmund have a very very decent manager and a good squad, tho a bit inexperienced/raw, especially at the back. And Barca have Valverde who I just don't think would have the same reputation he currently has had he been at another club. He's able to get his teams to control possession which is actually impressive but they can't do anything with it and as that crazy stat posted on here a couple weeks back showed, rely way too much on Messi. Basically I think if any of Dortmund/Barca/Inter play with heart then they'll have a 50/50 shot at winning the game so this group stage could end up turning real brutal lol. I predict the first few rounds everyone draws each other as they're afraid to lose and then the final two rounds just be absolute bloodbaths as one team goes from giving everything to stay in the competition to then defending for their lives while the other team puts up everything they have, and then etc.",
