As years have gone by, its become too much of a processionparade than a race for me, not enough space or opportunities to overtake on the circuit, making it more of a team tactics battle rather than a race. I do like the addition of some of the recent circuits such as Singapore and Azerbaijan as they have great opportunities for overtaking with some smart planning on the drivers part. EDIT Front page  Im so sorry to all the confused redditors! Also thank you to whomever gifted platinum, gold, and silver for this post. RIP inbox. EDIT 2 Some of you requested I make a post on rtifu about this, so here you go!  EDIT 3 I am in disbelief at this post being the 1 post on this sub! Absolutely incredible.",

Abu Dhabi  Very often a boring Tilkedrome that is a very anticlimatic season ender. Melbourne, Singapore, almost any street circuit  No overtakes. Sochi and Baku  Hosted at Petrostates and boring layout, Baku whenever drivers have their brains screwed correctly. France  Paul Ricard is a testing circuit, not a racing circuit. Terrible runoffs. Shit traffic to the circuit. Hungaoring and Barcelona  Hard to overtake. EDIT Im listing out most opinions to questions like the OP. Opinions are not my own, stop asking. Reading is apparently really hard.",

I mean its true that overtaking and overall positional changing is extremely hard, and if youre set through in qualifying, you do invariably end up on the podium barring a DNF. but thats the thing  its so easy to mess up on that track. The lanes are thin Street style and corners narrow, and the hairpin is an extreme. Safety car adds an additional dimension. Just my opinion tho, always fun to see drivers race in different conditions and this hard track is def something I enjoy. not so much on F1 2019 tho",

Id say the vast majority of drivers who have ever driven for a racechampionshipwinning team got their chance by first driving a less competitive car and being seen to outperform it. In fact itd be easier to list the drivers for which that wasnt the case, Lewis Hamilton straight into a winning McLaren in 2007 for his 1st season, Jacques Villeneuve 1996, Williams, who I previously mentioned as a backmarker but back then were the best team, equivalent of todays Mercedes are the only two obvious examples popping into my head from my time following the sport. Most other top drivers throughout the years have had some sort of apprenticeship. Leclerc the subject of this thread himself started with Sauber not at the very back, but a midfield team and performed well enough to make Ferrari want to sign him even though he never scored a win or podium with Sauber.",

Red Bull seemed to have the pace in the first half of the season, Mercedes really unlocked performance in the car in the later half. I disagree with the stewards call on lap 1, but think it would have been fairly moot in the end as Hamiltons pace was untouchable in the early part of this race. A heroic effort from Sergio to hold Lewis up wasnt enough to bring Max back into the fight. The free pitstop under VSC wasnt enough to bring Max back into the fight. Lewis had this in the bag. Then fate, and a tussle between Latifi and Schumacher intervenes and the safety car comes out. The FIA to decide whether to let all lapped cars go through and risk not having any laps of racing, or to leave them in place and have 1 lap of racing. Choosing at the last second to do both at once, and not only that but specifically only those between Max and Lewis is a variation ive never seen before and dont understand. Fresh Softs versus 40 lap old Hards is not racing, its being a sitting duck. I dont begrudge Max winning the 2021 season, he earned it. I do begrudge it being gifted to him this way with an as yet unseen rule.",

Pierre Gasly, of the Alpha Tauri team scored his first win in F1, which brings only the second race victory for Alpha Tauri since 2008 here at the same track. Gasly becomes the first French winner in the sport since Olivier Panis won in 1996. Pierre Gasly has faced a lot of hardship in his time at the pinnacle of motorsport, with his close friend Anthoine Hubert dying last year, and him losing his seat at Red Bull, the parent team of Alpha Tauri in the same week. This was a race where the leader had a major penalty which took him out of contention for the win and a major crash stopped the race in the middle of it, giving Gasly the chance to earn his first win. This is a major outlier, considering his car doesnt have the same pace as some of the top teams. In short, nearly every F1 fan is extremely joyous that he has picked up his first win today. Gasly has overcome a lot to be a race winner for the first time, so the F1 community is almost united in their love and appreciation for his win. Make sure to come back next week as we race another time in Italy, at the famous Mugello track for Ferraris 1000th race in F1!",

Edit since no one tweeted about it might as well add Alonso and Leclercs comments too However Fernando Alonso pointed out the decision whether the race should go ahead or not is out of their hands. I think its going to be Formula 1s decision eventually, said the Alpine driver. I dont think that we drivers we have our opinion and Im sure it is the same one as everyone. We dont have the power to decide. Things like that we can make our own decision for sure but eventually I think that Formula 1 will do the best. The GPDA will have to speak about it, said Charles Leclerc. But to not go too much into details because to be honest I dont have all the information about whats happening. Its very sad to see that, especially in 2022. Then well take a decision, I think Formula 1 will probably take a decision and have more info than we do.

Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the loser, and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red MMs are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue MMs as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snackfood world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one MM, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to MM Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 178401503 U.S.A., along with a 35 card reading, Please use this MM for breeding purposes. This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 12 pound bag of plain MMs. I consider this grant money. I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament.

Not racing would only be good if it was a joint decision by all drivers at the moment Qatar was announced, having it cancelled. A single driver  even Lewis Hamilton  doesnt have such power. Worst part is if he did exactly that, decided to boycott the GP, they would say he was only doing that to have an excuse to lose de WDC, or that he knew he didnt have a chance anyway.... its pathetic how people can shit on Lewis because of the things he has in common with every other driver being rich, a lot of plane rides, driving in countries with bad governments, just because the tries to do something within his reach.",

        "description": "TLDR For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter, with the intention to make this ban permanent in some form. Hey everyone! After yesterdays proposal we discussed within the mod team whether a full ban on Twitter content would be feasible. We had already been encouraging Bluesky as a source over other platforms, since by not forcing users to log in it is more accessible and it does not suffer from the various other issues affecting Twitter. Our main concern with a full ban is that while many F1 journalists have joined Bluesky, teams, drivers  FOM have not. But we also realize that its a chicken or the egg problem and as a community of almost 5 million, we probably have a nontrivial effect as to what platform is the native source for F1 news In the end weve settled on the following approach  For a trial period we will ban all content from Twitter with the only exception of screenshots of relevant posts by teams, drivers  F1 that are not available on any other platform. Even in case of major breaking news, we ask you to post links to the press releases or a screenshot of the post from Instagram, with a link in the comments.  We hope that this trial period will provide a nudge for F1 journalists, creators and teams to make their content available on alternative platforms as we intend to make this ban permanent in some form. Why a trial period? First of all, sometimes mods make bad decisions even if with the best intentions. For example in 2015 this subreddit banned images  gifs, which caused a controversy that was only resolved after Will Buxton stepped in to mediate the situation Second of all, this is one of the strictest approaches to Twitter content and strict bans like this can have unintended consequences, so we might need to later refine this ban. We intend the trial period to last at least until the first races of the new season, after which a final form of the ban would be implemented. This subreddit has had restrictions on what content can be posted for a very long time. Weve had the source rating system that labeled the quality of news sites and is still used for removing sensationalist and unoriginal articles. Weve also had limitations on Instagram due to its requirement for an account to view posts. Theres no doubt that over the past years Twitter has become a lowquality source the login requirements, the flood of bots, the prioritization of content from paying users and promotion of sensationalist content. But unlike with news sites in our sourcerating system, for Twitter there wasnt really an alternative. But now that viable alternatives are emerging and the proposal thread from yesterday has shown that the community prefers those alternatives, we think its time to try and see how the subreddit works without content from Twitter.  For journalists, photographers, creators  other F1 personalities Our preferred alternative platform is Bluesky and to help avoid impersonations we have created a list of verified F1 related accounts on Bluesky This list is used both for feeds  starter packs on Bluesky, but also for AutoModerator here on Reddit. We are adding new verified accounts whenever we come across them, but please contact us on Bluesky or send a modmail here on Reddit to accelerate this process. We want to assist with this transition and we also want to hear your feedback throughout this trial period, so please get in touch.",

And I get most news on X are bullshit but so are a lot of other media websites. Banning Twitter is not going to solve that issue, specially when youre still accepting news from other social media, where most news are just going to be fans trying to make something up. A better solution would be to check by moderators all posts tagged as news, but I guess is just easier to ban an entire social media, where it comes most of f1 content btw, just because of inability to let your political opinion out of entertainment.",

It is clear in most cases where difference in pace is obvious, say if someone is attempting to overtake 2021 Haas or a fresh pitted car is up against 20 lap old medium runners. But today, that difference is not apparently obvious. There are lot of battles in midfield and tailend. Also, neither Charles or Max would have accepted the other car is quicker than their own in the heat of battle and given up. Even then, it is impressive that they al kept clean of incidents. Probably stewards set a precendent giving 5 second penatly to Ocon early on? Not much at stake at this stage of championship? They dont want to risk without fully understanding their car and others cars? More respect towards each other? Either way, enjoyed proper clean battles and hope they stay that way for rest of the season.",

Holds off Zhou for an astonishing amount of laps basically 34th of the race. Finishes P9 after Ricciardo loses power. Latifi finishes 15th, only ahead of KMag, who had a 5 sec penalty and showed no pace. Nyck de Vries, despite his age, deserves that seat for at least one year. If he DOES get the seat, I think he will be close to Albon at least and together fight for points hopefully.",

Its not like Latifi cost them anything yet. Last year three were 9 pts between him and Russell... Which would not have changed anything on the standings. Even then, unless you suddenly spring into the top teams, thats probably only 10M max in the best of cases. Sponsorship is harder to put a hard number on, but its not like youre going to be suddenly a lot more prestigious by placing 6th. Then there the fact that any good driver isnt going to be cheap.

                "comentario": "Abortion is a wedge issue in the US, so Lewis stands to get both a lot of praise and criticism for speaking out. I find him brave to do so. ____ Whether Roe vs Wade is sound as a legal precedent or not, it still will be a sad day when bodily autonomy stands to be curtailed based on where in the US you live. Many states have already voted in trigger laws, which will effectively ban abortion the moment the Supreme Court strikes down Roe vs Wade. In some cases this will force minors and rape victims to carry to term unsolicited pregnancies without having any say in the matter. Even if it jeopardizes their lives. This is adding insult to injury. Im a middle aged man and not a US citizen so this will have no legal ramifications for me personally. It however saddens me deeply that bodily autonomy is not universally seen as a basic human right. My personal view is that I or someone else should not have the right to limit a womans choice to terminate an unwanted or potentially dangerous pregnancy, or to make such an action punishable by law. Even if a majority should object to abortion based on personal moral considerations, that by itself is not enough of an argument to selectively limit bodily autonomy for people based on their gender. One should have the freedom to either abort or not abort. That would still allow you the freedom to conduct yourself according to your own religious or moral stance on the issue. ____ Edit Regarding being antiabortion, a common argument is the sanctity of life. Once a fetus has developed the mother has no right to terminate this life. I find that morally shaky to be honest, since we dont consider swatting flies or exterminating rodents similarly objectionable. Rodents and even insects have a sense of self and autonomous agency. They have impulses and can consciously experience life. A fetus does not and cannot. The brain of a fetus doesnt start functioning fully until relatively late into the pregnancy. Way later than when the heart starts beating. When the brain of a fetus is not yet fully functioning it cannot be considered having personhood, making abortion until that point is reached, morally justified as being at the sole discretion of the pregnant woman. Even in special cases in the third trimester, when the fetus has died or forms a direct threat to the mother while suffering from extreme defects, abortions are still justifiable. The life of a mother should not be forcibly endangered when that is the consequence of carrying a pregnancy to term.",

I have so many questions, I dont know where to begin! As an American fan, I was intrigued when you had a stint with the NASCAR truck series during your sabbatical after the 2009 F1 season. 1. Given the fluctuation with popularity in American motorsports, would you ever consider giving the Indianapolis 500 a try especially with Ferrari setting up a team in INDYCAR? 2. Your F1 career will span 20 years if you are still with us for 2021. You are the last of the active drivers who were with us during the era of V10 engines. Youve been close to lots of drivers and team personnel. Do you haveany funny or interesting stories youd like to share with us in regards to who youve been close to during your career? 3. An interesting fact Ive learned about you is that you were the only driver to come to Formula 1 directly after racing in the Formula Renault series. Do you think your career would have been any different if you raced in F1s direct feeder series F3000? 4. Do you have a favorite brand of ice cream?",

As soon as Verstappen caught up to Norris, Hamilton bolts it and opens up a 3.3 second gap. Norris was only thinking about overtaking Hamilton. Hamilton was managing the pace vs. Norris while keeping tires to defend against a late charge. Norris seems to have a tendency to tunnel vision on winning, which may have cost him 2nd today. Hell need to grow out of it over time.",
