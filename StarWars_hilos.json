As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be specific like you said, then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing. If youre saying crow family youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people call the black ones crows? Lets get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? Its not one or the other, thats not how taxonomy works. Theyre both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But thats not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless youre okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means youd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you dont. Its okay to just admit youre wrong, you know?",

It was a fairly transparent attempt to use the mobile game business strategy that EA calls player engagement. Simply put, they want to motivate you to play the game as long as possible every day, so that youll be tempted to buy whatever microtransactions theyre pushing. Or, at the very least youll be there to keep the servers populated, so that the whales who do spend money on the microtransactions always have someone to play against.",

By this point in time, Coruscant was already a Galactic City for over 50,000 years. The Wookiees were nearly two million years old as a species. 160,000 years prior, spaceflight was a thing, and what became humans drove another species what became the Mandalorians off of Coruscant.

                "comentario": "This is a fun, silly scene. It shouldnt be there. It takes place in the middle of the Hoth evacuation. It is supposed to be a tense sequence  starting from General, theres a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of hyperspace in sector four pretty much all the way to when Luke gets to his XWing or when the Millennium Falcon takes off. This whole chunk of the film is a carefullypaced, action sequence, which builds up tension with a couple of outlets, puts the main characters under quite a bit of pressure, has quite a bit of death of good guys as well, and has a fairly sombre outcome the good guys lose sure, many of them escape and survive, but their base is destroyed and a lot of them die. Its not the kind of sequence you want to throw jokes into. There is some humour in there as there is throughout the OT, but it mainly comes from the characters being themselves particularly Han Solo making oneliners and quips at people  but thats what he does, and fits with his character the more serious he gets, the more he tries to deflect with insults etc.  Leia does the same. And for this part of the time, it all happens while furthering the plot in some way. The one exception is C3PO being dragged through the door after it shuts in front of him  and personally I find that shot a little jarring and out of place. This shot the wampas and Snowtroopers requires three bits in the film to make it work something to establish the Rebels have captured Wampas or have a problem with Wampas getting into parts of the base iirc this was in the script at some point, not sure if it was ever filmed. Second, we need the setup of C3PO removing the sign during the highstakes race to the Falcon. Third, we need the payoff when the Snowtroopers, chasing the Rebels, open the door. Thats three decentlylong shots or bits of script dedicated to a joke, which arent furthering the plot. Finally, this sequence involves C3PO acting out of character. Why would he remove the sign? That would go against protocol, surely? Why does he stop when in danger of being left behind? We dont even care about the Snowtroopers being mauled by wampas maybe if it slowed them down for a bit longer and that had a clearer payoff later it might work, or if someone other than C3PO had removed the sign showing sneakiness and cunning  not traits 3PO is known for. But as it is, it doesnt quite fit. So for that scene to be included, we have to break the drama, add in 23 extra shots with no plot reason, have to pull someone out of character, all for a single joke where the punch line is some random Snowtroopers getting attacked by a wampa arm. Im glad someone said no to that scene. I wish there was someone like that working on the Prequels and Sequels to say no to some of the random jokes.",

They also basically forbade their own followers from studying the dark side openly, and generally punished or killed those Jedi that did so. That isnt balance, that is borderline genocide.

There is no ignorance, there is knowledge. There is no passion, there is serenity. There is no chaos, there is harmony. There is no death, there is the Force although one of mace windus disciples and younger jedi apparently started reciting this creed, which i agree with more, but is very different than the first idealogically. Emotion, yet peace. Ignorance, yet knowledge. Passion, yet serenity. Chaos, yet harmony. Death, yet the Force the original creed lead to things, from my perspective, like anakin not allowed to be married, because love is also a powerful emotion that could cloud his judgement, being devoid of wordly anchors was more important to the order than teaching the disciples how to control and segregate their emotions when performing their duties.",

The idea of Padme dying to unknown causes was enough to make Anakin vulnerable what if somebody kidnapped or killed a Jedis wife? The average Jedi would be at much greater risk of falling. The problem with Anakin was that he was trained too late in life. Jedi are supposed to be raised with those ideals, to reject those kinds of connects and to see them as the risks they are. Their parental figures, the Jedi themselves, would espouse to them how they shouldnt even become too attached to them. Anakin, however, was raised by his doting mother. He had already formed strong connections by time he even entered training, and it was too late to try and teach him that those sorts of connections were bad. Connections to his mother led to the slaughter of the Sand People. Connections to Padme led to his entire fall. Hell, connection to his son actually led to his fall from the Dark Side back into the light. Its not even a Dark versus Light thing... connections just inhibit focus and dedication. Its not like Palpatine had a side piece that made him soft. No wonder Kylo Ren is so bent on killing his own family. Theyre a huge weak point for any Force user, especially Skywalkers.",

It wouldve been more respectable if Rey established herself as neither a Jedi nor a Sith, but rather as a Grey Force user of sorts walking her own path, instead of ignoring her Palpatine side and larping as a Skywalker. It wouldve been thematically in line with her characters loneliness. My biggest problem is that for all the pretense Disney has about marketing Rey as a Jedi, she sure as hell doesnt act like one. She constantly lets her emotions get the better of her, she fights with a wild and unbalanced style, shes full of unbridled rage half the time, and the one time she beat Kylo Ren, she stabbed him in the stomach when he was distracted, like an assassin. This would have been palatable, perhaps even thematically interesting, had the trilogy actually spent time delving into Lukes reformation of the Jedi Order and how his ideals for the new generation of Jedi differed from that of old, but the trilogy never really addressed the Jedi in such a meaningful manner. So given what we know of how Jedi are supposed to act and live, Rey is about the furthest thing from a Jedi without going full Sith. Theres just this dissonance between the aesthetic of Reys character and what Disney wants us to think her character is, and I just cannot get over it.",

He clearly had history with him, he was aware of either Luke or Leia, Id have liked to find out, maybe through some Luke exposition, how he tied in with things in layer films. But no, he just got tossed in the trash, apparently with any ideas of a continuous narrative, like so many other dead ends, and I found it a fitting comparison to the trilogy as a whole. Maybe it got covered in a comic series, like Lukes fight with the Knights of Ren or Kylos crossguard saber explanation, but it would have been real nice to see it happen or heard it explained on screen, not read about it on Comic ComicVine or some shit.",

There was an old thought that the force was stronger when a jedi died, as they were then connected with the force. This could be the reasoning behind the search to maintain consciousness after death in the clone wars animated series by Yoda. But Ill digress and move on. Two  the potential for the number of force sensitives could be a limited thing, but with the mass deaths, and the lack of anyone finding these people and training them, 10000 jedi died in the purge presumably per Rebels at least that would be a large number of potential force sensitives. Eh. Thats at least how I think about it. Edit Afterthought  all beings are sensitive to the force, the question is to what extent  source Rebels  animals can be more sensitive to it than people in some cases. When the mass death happened, the force potentially grew with all of the life forms contributing their living energy back to the cosmic force. Different kinds of force being living and cosmic, if I remember correctly. Source TCW episode with the Father, Sister, and Brother. Main point which the above post attempts to provide evidence for  Mass genocide of force sensitives caused mass amount of new force sensitives.",

So when TCW comes out and makes Anakin a more likable and heroic character, that makes it better. The ST just sends the horrible message that nothing that happens in the first six movies matter. The Empire comes back and takes over the galaxy again, the Jedi are destroyed again, the OT heroes all end up failures who die relatively young, Palpatine wasnt actually defeated and gets revenge everyone by destroying their lives.

I hope they do it like Final Fantasy VII Remake. To me that combat is just chefs kiss Perfect. It would fit with KoTOR perfectly. If you havent played it, every character has a unique moveset. The game controls in real time until an Active Time Battle gauge fills up which lets you pause the action to select various actions like use a special ability, cast spells, or use items. This makes it so you are managing trying to get your time gauge up as fast as possible, while also attacking strategically so you dont get hit. You can also switch between party members, and need to depending on the enemies, who each play different, one with sword, staff, guns, fists, etc. Thatd fits KoTOR to a T IMO. Ill be honest the combat most of the time in KoTOR I find kind of boring, so this would be an excellent way to update it while still keeping a lot of the core strategy in tact.",

If it had been the PoeFinn story it would have been time because they would have been able to develop them. Instead due to limited screen time and interaction we get weirdness in the fan community and China. Seriously TLJ should have had many things done differently, but Getting Finn and Poe off the ship together in an adventure would have resolved that easily and been more interesting.",

The CM was clearly thrown by the question and before she could answer this woman had gotten down on all fours, lifted her dress up, and crawled inside. It was such a WTF moment. Elsa was shocked. The photographer was shocked. Those of us in line were horrified and fascinated. But no one said a damn thing to her! They snapped a pic of this crazy bitch with her face peeking out from underneath the hemline of Elsas dress and let her go on her merry way. That was the day I realized that whatever CMs get paid, its not enough.",

Or the dynamic of the ancient space empires and how they tied into the current structure of the galaxy. Or how the Sith were virtually impossible to wipe out because there were more than enough holocrons and ghosts around it was like a game of whackamole for the Banites. Or how the Falcon was the fastest ship in the galaxy due to modifications by a hyperspace theorist who disappeared shortly after. Little things that add up to affect the whole feel of the franchise, gone. And not brought back because Pablo is full of himself.",

I do not do commission builds at this time, but I am working on a modern ambulance conversion at the moment. 5. I think this would cost between 10k15k to build, not including the UHaul or the labor. 6. There would be an access door to the cab through the falcon tunnel! 7. As for the exterior, I was thinking of painting it in the style of R2D2 8. The drawing doesnt show that the Death Star style window would have a motorized slide up shade with the Death Star targeting screen on it, there will be a long window on the back behind the booth, and the kitchen would have upper cabinets. 9. I designed the basic layout in SketchUp, that way all the proportions are right, then draw the finished idea in Procreate on my iPad Pro Edit added things",

That would have created a lot of conflict within him  as it still did later  because he wasnt ready to understand the difference between the light side and the dark side. And second, because its accurate. Ive learned over the years to challenge myself on my beliefs, to realize there are alternative points of view. Heck we see that playing out right now in the world  the pandemic, racism, etc. Not saying both sides are right but it helps to understand that the other side does see things differently and if you at least try to understand their perspective you can learn something at the very least, how to counter their arguments.",

A contractor comes into the store and overhears Randal telling Dante that in order to complete the second deathstar, the Empire must have hired independent contractors, plumbers and builders and all that, to get it done quickly and quietly after the first one was destroyed. Randal had no problem with the first one being destroyed as it was probably only inhabited by imperials, evil is punished, no big. But the second one was a bunch of apolitical contractors who were just trying to scrape out a living on a big, well paying job. The contractor in the store tells a story of how he, a roofer, was offered a simple reshingling job, and that if he could do it in a day, his pay would be doubled. The contractor tells of how he figured out whose house it was and turned it down. The house belonged to a gangster. He knew the man, knew what he was capable of, and turned it down. The money was good, but the risk was too high. He didnt wanna risk upsetting a mob boss. So he passed that job onto a buddy. While the buddy was working on the house, a rival gang puts out a hit on the mobster and his buddy gets shot in the crossfire. Wasnt even done reshingling the house. Those contractors knew the risk going into working on the death star. But they took the job anyway.

Lots of vids around the web of Hamill complaining about shitty writing. Luke projecting himself to talk and diss Kylo before dying of exhaustion was so disappointing. I mean, thats it? The great Luke Skywalkers final battle  is a circus trick?! Hamill should have refused to work for them after reading that script, instead he ruined a childhood hero and fond memories for millions of people through 3 generations all around the world and took the money. Now he spends his time lecturing people on twitter about politics and morals. Most of JJ productions are average at best, he shouldnt be allowed to direct anything else but Transformers movies. Awesome FX and big explosions got old as fast as John Wicks gun fu, adding some depth and meaning is a must today, the Mandalorian generated more hype and love for the Star Wars franchise than anything else since it was revived. Huxley, Snoke, the Shiny Stormtrooper chick, Knights of Ren, potential love interests the pilot and the chick with the red helmetcostume all those things could have been expanded on to make the trilogy much more human. Some could reveal secrets, others turn to the Resistances cause, etc.  Finns love interest No clue what that was about or where it came from. We watch thousands of resistance ships and people die in the beginning just to kill a single one of those new empire destroyers. And an hour later they just turn around and cut the biggest ship ever made in half with a hyperspace jump. That was pure comedy. I would have rather watched this instead of what we got",

Vader asks Palpatine if he knew about this to which Palpatine replies of course not...hehehe. One of my other favorite short stories is a comic of an older ex storm trooper talking about the glory days of the empire and someone calling him out by asking how can imperial storm troopers get beaten by a bunch of ewoks. The ex storm trooper then explains how diabolical and fucking evil the ewoks were and how they were hunted down by them during the Battle of Endor. Great stuff.",

He cut off Maces hand in an act of desperation, saving the one guy who could teach him how to save her. Once he realised his mistake, he knew he had to fully commit or be destroyed. After this point, I saw his actions as an attempt to gain power. In this path, he was likely corrupted and blinded by it after doing something as bad as killing younglings. He had to double down, facing off against ObiWan. He still either needed the power to save Padme, wanted to gain enough power to overthrow the true evil of Palpatine and implement his own, just empire and likely still genuinely upset at the Jedi order, much like Ashoka. After his defeat and maiming by ObiWan, it again solidified his reliance on dark for any chance at eventually stopping Palpatine. He was furious at himself for killing his true love and being blinded enough by the dark to do it. At this point, I believe even his plunge into the dark was good intentioned. He needed power to overthrow Palpatine and turn the empire into a good empire, much like he fantasized about to Padme in The Clone Wars movie. Eventually, his son gave him the opportunity to do what he had always wanted, stopping the true evil force.",

All he has left is Palpatine, and the Empire that has brought peace to the galaxy. So he continues down the dark path. He encounters Ahsoka and Obiwan, his two closest friends, and they both understandably denounce him as a monster out of hand.

Not that JJ looked like he was creating an amazing trilogy, but whoever decided to let Rian take film 2 and let him do whatever the fuck he wanted is the real back breaker here. It was honestly the most disrespectful thing Ive ever seen done in the film world. He took JJs story and characters and gave him a fucking massive middle finger THROUGH the medium of a Star Wars movie. Fuck that noise. Watching that third movie it felt kinda good watching JJ throwing some of it back in Rians face like writing off Finns love interest  but thats the moment I realized that the trilogy was hot garbage.

He is the best there is at what he does. The best there has ever been. And he knows it.   HoloNet features call him the Hero With No Fear. And why not? What should he be afraid of?   Except   Fear lives inside him anyway, chewing away the firewalls around his heart.   Anakin sometimes thinks of the dread that eats at his heart as a dragon. Children on Tatooine tell each other of the dragons that live inside the suns smaller cousins of the sundragons are supposed to live inside the fusion furnaces that power everything from starships to Podracers.   But Anakins fear is another kind of dragon. A cold kind. A dead kind.   Not nearly dead enough.   Not long after he became ObiWans Padawan, all those years ago, a minor mission had brought them to a dead system one so immeasurably old that its star had long ago turned to a frigid dwarf of hypercompacted trace metals, hovering a quantum fraction of a degree above absolute zero. Anakin couldnt even remember what the mission might have been, but hed never forgotten that dead star.   It had scared him.   Stars can die?   It is the way of the universe, which is another manner of saying that it is the will of the Force, ObiWan had told him. Everything dies. In time, even stars burn out. This is why Jedi form no attachments all things pass. To hold on to somethingor someonebeyond its time is to set your selfish desires against the Force. That is a path of misery, Anakin the Jedi do not walk it.   That is the kind of fear that lives inside Anakin Skywalker the dragon of that dead star. It is an ancient, cold dead voice within his heart that whispers all things die    In bright day he cant hear it battle, a mission, even a report before the Jedi Council, can make him forget its even there. But at night   At night, the walls he has built sometimes start to frost over. Sometimes they start to crack.   At night, the deadstar dragon sometimes sneaks through the cracks and crawls up into his brain and chews at the inside of his skull. The dragon whispers of what Anakin has lost. And what he will lose.   The dragon reminds him, every night, of how he held his dying mother in his arms, of how she had spent her last strength to say I knew you would come for me, Anakin    The dragon reminds him, every night, that someday he will lose ObiWan. He will lose Padmé. Or they will lose him.  All things die, Anakin Skywalker. Even stars burn out",

        "description": "Here I will seek to establish that Jar Jar Binks, far from being simply the bumbling idiot he portrays himself as, is in fact a highly skilled force user in terms of martial ability and mind control. Furthermore, I assert that he was not, as many people assume, just an unwitting political tool manipulated by Palpatine rather, he and Palpatine were likely in collaboration from the very beginning, and its entirely possible that Palpatine was a subordinate underling to Binks throughout both trilogies. And finally, given the above, I will conclude with an argument as to why I believe it is not only possible, but plausible that Jar Jar will make a profound impact on the upcoming movies, and what his role may be.  So first, lets establish Jar Jar as a skilled warrior. While this does not in itself necessitate a connection with the Physical Force, its highly suggestive in the Star Wars universe very rarely do we see normal characters exhibiting extraordinary stuntwork or physical feats unless they are Jedi, Sith, or at least force sensitives. So heres Jar Jar nonchalantly executing a standing 20 foot twisting somersault Now, taken out of context, if you were watching a Star Wars movie and saw a character casually execute this maneuver, youd probably assume it was a Jedi. In the context of Jar Jar, though, we dont... because elsewhere he so thoroughly convinces us that hes nothing more than a harmless dunce with his inane dialogue and cowardlylion act. He also manages to convince us that hes a bumbling oaf in the midst of pitched battle... even though hes always incredibly, amazingly successful. Whether singlehandedly taking down a battledroid tank, or unleashing a barrage of boombas on their front lines, or precisely targeting multiple enemies with a blaster tangled around his ankle !!!, we simply roll our eyes and attribute it to dumb luck. But is it? ObiWan warned us otherwise. This is one of the main reasons we as an audience hate Jar Jar so thoroughly he breaks the fourth wall, he he shatters our suspension of disbelief, because we know that no one is really that lucky. We dismiss it as a lame, cliched trope the silly pathetic oaf who always seems to inadvertently save the day. I posit that, instead, this is a deliberate facade on the part of Jar Jar as a character, and on the part of the writers and animators. As we know, the Jedi themselves are inspired by Shaolin Monks, and theres a particular kung fu discipline that Jar Jars physicality is purposefully modeled upon which allows him to appear goofy and uncoordinated even as he lays waste to his enemies namely, Zui Quan or Drunken Fist wushu. This discipline seeks to imitate the sloshing, seemingly random foibles of a drunkard, but in reality the staggering and stumbling is the use of bodily momentum, deception, and unpredictability intended to lure and confuse opponents. Lets take a look at Jar Jar displaying some wushu the compasion clips are taken from an instructional Zui Quan video Jar Jar kippingup Zui Quan Comparison Jar Jar sloshing Zui Quan Comparison Jar Jar Sweeps the Leg Zui Quan Comparison if you slow down the above gif youll notice how Jar Jar dodges an incoming blaster shot at the very beginning. Youll also notice how hes mysteriously aware of the droideka as it appears behind him, even though it isnt in his line of sight and he couldnt possibly hear it over the din of battle.... Jar Jar Centering himself in preparation for a Force jump Zui Quan Comparison ...ok, thats all well and good, but even if Jar Jar is a secret Drunken Fist boxing master, that doesnt make him a force user, right? Well, it should at least make us suspicious of his character period. It establishes that his overthetop, childish antics are a veneer masking a more complex character than were led to believe. But even if you choose to ignore Jar Jars seemingly magical prescience in battle, I believe that there is a particular scene in which we do see him clearly make use of the physical force... In TPM, when Jar Jar and the Jedi ambush the droids and rescue the queen and her entourage, Jar Jar accidentally botches his leap from the balcony. A few frames later, he is seen dropping from the opposite side of the balcony, which would seem to be quite be impossible without a force assisted jump andor force sprint of some kind. Lets take a look at the full scene Jar Jar Ambush Note that as they sneak up, Jar Jar is just as effortlessly stealthy as his Jedi counterparts. Interesting. Now as I said, we see Jar Jar catch hold of the balcony on the far right side, but then he drops to the ground on the far left. Easy to dismiss as a continuity or framing error, I suppose... except that one of the droids continues to fire on Jar Jars initial position, even as we see him drop elsewhere! Here it is in slowmotion See the droid that comes charging up, right behind the one QuiGon chops down? Whats he shooting at up there?? And see its head swing back towards Jar Jars new position after the shot? You can also see another droid behind it tracking Jar Jar with its head, and manage a shot on the new position. This means that the animators knew very well where Jar Jar was supposed to be dangling from the balcony over QuiGons left shoulder and purposefully animate the droids tracking his inexplicably fast movement elsewhere. I think what has happened here, even though we dont see it directly, is that Jar Jar has purposefully split the attention of the enemies by grabbing on to the balcony as he falls, and then using the force propelled himself with a pullupflip to land in an unexpected place. In fact, this is a maneuver weve seen before from a jedi. Twice, if you want to count ObiWan doing it in the Duel of Fates to take Maul by surprise. In addition to this kind of highly suspicious physical luck, I also believe that were given enough clues to justifiably suspect that Jar Jar is also a master of Jedi Mind Control. Consider We hate the way Jar Jar influences major plot points for the same reason we hate his physicality it messes with our sense of realism. Two experienced Jedi on a serious mission would never actually bring someone that stupid along with them. No character that idiotic would ever really be made a general. They certainly wouldnt be made a senator. How could anyone like Jar Jar really convince the entire galaxy to abandon democracy? Thats ridiculous. These things are just the political version of his physical luck. Inadvertent, seemingly comical bumbling that just so happens to result in astoundingly positive results. But what if it isnt inadvertant, and what if Jar Jars meteoric rise and inexplicable influence isnt the result of dumb happenstance, but the result of extensive and careful use of force mind powers? Jedi and presumably Sith exhibit telltale signs when using the Mind Trick to implant suggestions or influence behavior. For one, they always gesticulate and notsosubtly wave their hands at the target. Heres a look at some pivotal Jar Jar moments during his political career Jar Jar handwaving his way towards a promotion to Bombad General  Jar Jar handwaving his way towards a promotion to the Senate  Jar Jar using Force Persuasion as he handwaves the entire Galactic Senate and ushers in the death of democracy. Actually, if you watch the prequels with the idea that Jar Jar might be a manipulative, dark character, you begin to notice just how insidious and subtle his manipulation is, and how effective, in almost every sequence hes involved in, and also just how hyperaware of the overarching plot he really is. Examples Jar Jar tricking the Jedi into traveling through the planet core so that they need him. Jar Jar carefully causing a scene so that they run into Anakin. Jar Jar constantly mocking QuiGon behind his back while Anakin is watching so that Anakin learns disrespect for Jedi authority early on. Jar Jar telling an 8 year old child that the queen is pretty hot, fanning the flames of the childs infatuation that is exploited later on. I could go on. Now if you lend even the slightest credence to my above points, and acknowledge the possibility that Jar Jar might not be an idiot, youre almost forced to conclude that Jar Jar Binks and Palpatine were coconspirators. If Jar Jar is putting forth an elaborate act to deceive people, it means hes not a fool... and if hes not a fool, it means his actions in Episode II that facilitate Palpatines plans are not those of an unwitting tool they are those of a partner. Remember Palpatine and Jar Jar are from the same planet, which in the scale of the Star Wars universe is like growing up as next door neighbors. Its entirely possible that they knew each other for years prior to TPM perhaps they trained together, or one trained the other. And Naboo is a really strange planet, actually remember those odd ancient statues with the third eye? Naboo is the kind of place an outcast Gungan might find a Sith holocron or two. But thats just speculation. Lets stick to what we know what we know is that even after Palpatine is elected as Chancellor, years after Jar Jar has been tricked into helping elect him, Palpatine still hangs out with Jar Jar in RotS. Why? Wouldnt he be a constant source of public embarrassment? This is the same character who cant walk five yards without stepping in poodoo or squealing like a rabid donkey, right? What use does he have now? Why is he still at the right hand of the most powerful person in the galaxy? Could it be that in fact Jar Jar is the most powerful person in the galaxy? Fine. Maybe. Hilarious conspiracy theory, but why would George Lucas bother to create this devious Gungan character with an elaborate conspiratorial past, but then never actually reveal his true nature? Heres George Lucas from a documentary talking about Yoda Yoda really comes from a tradition in mythological storytelling fairy tales of the hero finding a little creature on the side of the road that seems very insignificant and not very important, but who turns out to be the master wizard, or the master thing... As we all know, one of Lucas big deals with the prequels was that they were intended to rhyme and mirror the original trilogy in terms of general narrative themes. So there should have been a seemingly innocent creature found on the side of the road that later reveals itself as a major player. We do have a creature that this seems to describe precisely... Jar Jar... but of course he never develops into a master anything. Heres what I think happened I think that Jar Jar was initially intended to be the prequel and Dark Side equivalent of Yoda. Just as Yoda has his big reveal when we learn that his tottering, geriatric goofball persona is just a mask, Jar Jar was intended to have a big reveal in Episode II or III where we learn that hes not really a naive dope, but rather a master puppeteer Sith in league with or perhaps in charge of Palpatine. However, GL chickened out. The fan reaction to Jar Jar was so vitriolic that this aspect of the trilogy was abandoned. Just too risky... if Jar Jar is truly that offputting, its potentially ruinous to the Star Wars legacy to imply that hes the ultimate bad guy of the entire saga. So pretend he was just a failed attempt at comic relief instead. This is why Dooku seems like such a flat, shoehornedin character with no backstory he was hastily written in to cover the plot holes left when villain Jar Jar was redacted. Yoda was meant to duel with his literal darkside nemesis and mythological equivalent at the end of AotC not boring old Count Dooku, but Sith Master Jar Jar. And Binks was meant to escape, not just that duel but to survive the entire trilogy... so that he could cast a shadow on the OT, too youd rewatch the originals knowing that the Emperor wasnt necessarily the big baddie after all... Jar Jar is still out there somewhere. It would have been sort of brilliant. But I believe it is likely that the writers of the new trilogy will resurrect this idea. Most people seem to think that Disney wishes to distance or somehow disassociate itself from the prequels... but this doesnt actually make any economic or marketing sense. There is far more prequelera based intellectual property to capitalize on than there is OT, if only because of the Clone Wars movie and series. Billions of dollars in iconic toys, images, characters, games, park rides, etc that an entire younger generation grew up on. Disney is not going to pretend that over half of the 4 billion in IP they bought simply isnt worth acknowledging. and anyway, we have behind the scenes TFA footage clearly showing imagery being reused from the prequels. Also, many of the flags above Mazs castle in the trailer are from TPM No, it stands to reason that one of their primary goals will be to reinvigorate and ultimately try to redeem the prequels in the eyes of the fanbase. To elevate and improve them retroactively, as much as possible. So how do you do that? Jar Jar Binks has undoubtedly become the face of everything that is wrong with the prequels he was too silly, too unbelievable, seemingly pointless. If you are able to somehow change the nature of Jar Jar from embarrassing idiot to jawdropping villain, suddenly the entire prequel trilogy must be seen in a new light, because it becomes the setup for the most astounding reveal in film history Jar Jar Binks is Supreme Leader Snoke!",

They probably wanted him to be really funny, endearing and adorable the same way Yoda was when hes stealing Lukes flashlight and bonking him on the head, but instead they made him this obnoxious presence that singlehandedly makes episode 1 a significantly worse movie. I guess it still couldve worked if episode 2 was done really, really well. But nobody had any love for Jar Jar after episode 1, so I could really easily see it turning into pure rage. Oh come on, theyre just trying to justify how awful he was in episode 1, this character is the worst and now hes IMPORTANT too? etc etc Who knows, though. Maybe GL is a visionary master and he was completely willing to make one movie worse just to give audiences a mindblowing twist in episode 2. I prefer it to the alternative, which is just that he thought Jar Jar was really really funny and everyone wanted to see lots of him in episode 1. P",

                "comentario": "Warning TLDR material. But here goes I am pretty much sold on Lumpawarroos theory nevertheless, Jar Jar had to be suppressed. They made the right call. nbsp Truly, you have earned a seat in the Jedi Council of Star Wars Scholarship, Lumpawarroo. I have no idea if Jar Jar was ever intended to be the prequels ultimate lynchpin of evil though I would no longer be surprised if that were case. But I now believe that Jar Jar was at the very least a dark agent that nobody would suspect. Ahmed Best the Jar Jar actor has pretty much confirmed as much in his tweet  unless hes just trying to stir the pot. But after years of abuse, I think hes genuinely reveling in the public reaction to the theory . nbsp Here is my question would there really have been a stronger reception for the prequel series if they had stuck with the game plan? Prevailing opinion seems to be yes. But Ive reached the conclusionand this truly pains methat they made the right call to stem the bleeding. Think about it. Can you recall such backlash to any character in any blockbuster movie series in the history of cinema? Sure, people hated Paulies stupid robot in Rocky IV, but come on! That one got just 36 reddit comments  The now esteemed director Sofia Coppola certainly didnt suffer the pummeling for her role in Godfather Part III that Jar Jar did. Fandom was almost violent in their response to Jar Jar. The fact that Lumpawarroos post has generated so much attention speaks to the collective hatred Planet Earth had for this character. nbsp To be clear, I honestly wish there were a way they couldve made it work. But there are three reasons why I think they made the right decision to put a lid on Jar Jar. nbsp 1 We werent as discerning or critical about CGI in 1999 as we are today, but we still had no tolerance for CGI Jar Jar. He looked cartoonish in a universe of cool and even acceptably cuddly yet rugged characters like the Ewoks. A deceptively oafish character wouldve worked if we enjoyed his physical presence, a la Donkey in Shrek. We didnt. We HATED seeing JJB onscreen. And I dont believe the voice characterization was the major factor. Rembember that the Star Wars CGI was now being compared to the superior quality seen in LotR Fellowship in 2001. The Jar Jar CGI was about to be destroyed by Gollum and Ent CGI in The Two Towers in 2002. If Jar Jar were given the Darth Vader reveal in RotS, I think those who would have appreciated the subterfuge would have been vastly outnumbered by those who would have felt cheated and manipulated. Nobody wanted to see this poorlyexecuted, cartoonish turd pulling the strings all along. Im sorry but you know what they say about hindsight. nbsp 2 I dont like bashing George Lucas. He is the architect of the most iconic film brand of all time including LotR and its pioneering infrastructure. But as many have said over the years and often cruelly, he is not at his best when hes at the helm of these pictures. Even with this shocking twist intact, Lucass writing and direction were not strong enough to make us feel better about the prequel installments. The Lucas approach to revealing Jar Jar as a dark highly skilled force user may have turned a lackluster effort into an outright embarrassment. Perhaps another director could have made it interesting as Irvin Kershner improved on Star Wars with ESB, but Lucas was having none of that for his pet prequels. nbsp 3 Here, Im thinking only as a film exec, not as a fan. The bottom line always matters. Yes, any film carrying the Star Wars mantle will make money, but the profit bar for these properties was set very high. I suspect that the players at Lucasfilm and 20th Century Fox pressured GL to make a course correction. Give the people what they want, George! They want to see BELOVED characters kicking ass. Sure, Count Dooku may seem oddly important all of a sudden, but we have Christopher Fing Lee. Thats gravitas, man! Hell give us an awesome fight scene with Yoda. And what do they really want? They want the Anakin to Vader transformation. They want the ObiWanVader showdown. Thats the end game. What do they NOT want? The great and powerful Jar Jar. They had already seen box office declines in ESB and RotJ from the originals 307 domestic gross in 1977. Nobody wanted to risk Episodes II and III truly tanking due to the forced significance of a universally despised character whose arc wasnt already predetermined in classic novels. nbsp If the prequels were in different creative hands, maybe a Jar Jar as unlikelyevilconspirator reveal would have worked. It may have killed! But there was no way to backtrack into brilliance. At that time, Jar Jar Binks had to be squashed. Could he be revived into something greater in The Force Awakens? I cant wait to find out.",

I guess my point is if you see the beauty in similar things, people can probably see similar things in your work. Humility can have its drawbacks  Cool photo! Glad to hear that Star Wars is still capturing all ages. Im 28 and I am still a huge fan. I finally caught RoS last night and while it wasnt my favorite, I still loved it as more Star Wars Ben Solo baby!. I remember playing with tons of action figures, making my own Lego Jedi with a friend and building our own story through our creations, being Vader for Halloween, and then Maul. Playing so many games like Shadows of the Empire and Star Wars ObiWan, Battlefront and Clone Wars, and so many more. Its pretty amazing that the franchise has such strong foundations that it can put out so many stories and products, and so many things for all sorts of people to love. My only humble tip is to consider depth of field with your smoke. The one further away should be blurrier so that it matches the other objects at that distance.",

I see the pity upvotes a lot in all communities and I just dont think its right. People are saying that its pathetic for adults to hate on kids which in some cases is true, however I think age is irrelevant here. I feel that it happens with women as well. In many subreddits that are mostly directed towards guys, you will sometimes see posts that standout just because op put female in the title.
