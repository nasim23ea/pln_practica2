Before it was intentional, to help create a sense of status quo  a false sense of calm  to signal to the viewer that nothing bad could happenthe good guys will be fine by deflating the sense of stakes. This culminates in Infinity War, which is jam packed with misleading humor to the point of absurdity... which makes the finale of it hit so much harder, because its a totally humorless 180 to the established tone. Weve been totally mislead, tonally misprepared for what was going to happen, making the ending even more shocking and horrifying. I also like the humor doesnt really EFFECTIVELY come back, with any hardhitting one liners until after the portals scene in Endgame. The status has returned back to hopeful, and humor being reinjected into the tone reflects that shift back to optimism. As a result, I would say the jokes during that final Endgame battle and then he did the handwavy sparkles thing...you take the little oneetc are my favorite, because they serve the strongest actual narrative purpose.",

That means Marvel would make the movie but the majority of the profits come from distributing the film to theaters. So Marvel would see very little profit when making a stand alone Hulk movie. Those rights didnt extend to using the character though, only when Hulk was the main character. Thats why we saw Hulk in other movies just not in another Hulk movie. Sony owns all the rights to Spiderman but saw how well the MCU movies were doing and decided it was in their best interest to make a deal to allow Marvel to use the character in the MCU instead of rebooting the franchise on their own once again. Supposedly the Universal deal was for 15 years which would then have expired in 2023 but Marvel hasnt really acknowledged that so it remains to be seen if they will now do a stand alone Hulk movie or not.",

Because hes the heavy hitter he cant be brought down. Instead, with members of the team either being captured or incapacitated, Spencer is thrown into a situation where his brute force cannot solve the problem. If they had written hulk like that, throwing him into problems that doesnt beat him physically but he cant win with his brawn, I feel like his heavy hitter status wouldve been a lot better.

The lower end, like Cap, get buffed, and the ones at the top get nerfed. So yeah, Hulk is nerfed. Most characters are. I do think people underrate Hulks feats by picking the instances that he loses and ignoring context. Hulk generally only loses 1v1s that the other Avengers wouldnt get close to managing. In AOU, Hulk runs into prime Ultron on the Quinjet, and just absolutely bodies him. Even if Ultron was injured, Iron Man struggled a lot more against an earlier version of Ultron that didnt have vibranium. Hulks fight against Hulkbuster is mostly Hulk winning, with him getting sucker punched at the end. And Bruce helped build the armor. In Thor Ragnarok, Hulk ties with Thor and was honestly winning for the beginning of the match until Thor goes super saiyan. Hulk later staggers a being that explodes Asgard with a single strike. In Infinity War, he goes toe to toe with Thanos, and staggers him a lot more than anybody else does for the rest of the seriesincluding Thor. Yeah, he gets beaten fast, but Thanos is Hulk level strong and incredibly skilled. The Avengers needed Thor, Iron Man, Captain Marvel, and Cap with Mjolnir to stand a chance against him later. Smart Hulk snapping with the gauntlet is such an underrated strength feat. He also holds up the entire Avengers facility right after, despite it clearly being shown as something that seriously injures the strongest beings. In She Hulk, he plays around with her in their fight scenes. His thunderclap is like 20 times more powerful than hers, and he throws a boulder thats 3 times his size into space. Of course he isnt going to murder her, but its clearly shown that even in his smaller Smart Hulk form, hes more powerful. Compare Hulks losses and ask if any other Avenger would fare as well on their own. The only one thats really suspect is Hulkbuster, and even that is an asterisk win because Hulk was mind controlled.",

Ill try to simplify the whole thing. Hemes are ironcontaining porphyrins. As you might have guessed, hemes are part of heme proteins, and those guys are part of something we call Hemoglobin,which plays a huge role in body processes, oxygen transfer for example. Hemes, while being useful, also can be toxic, particularly in high amounts. They also participate in processes, which promote cell growth. And you know whats an abnormal cell growth usually called? A tumor. That, and there is also belief that some nitrites and nitrates, which are used in order to preserve the meat, have negative effect on our genes and cells.",

For most, thats usually LA, Atlanta, or NYC. Then comes trying to hold a regular day job while also going on countless auditions. I have a couple friends who are fairly successful actors not rich and famous, but making a decent living, and it took a good ten years of nonstop grinding just to get to the point where they were booking jobs regularly enough to do it full time.

Ive had my own idea for a while about an animated Marvel series Id want to do, where Hydra specifically the Cabal, the group that runs Hydra in this version is the main villain. The current head of the Cabal is Baron Helmut Zemo, whose father Heinrich led it during WWII. Heinrich was the one who partnered Hydra with the Axis Powers, making them Nazis. In the present, Helmut is mildly embarrassed of the previous ties to the Nazi Party, and tries to cast a wider net with the present version of Hydra. However, its regularly shown and called out by the heroes that a Nazi by any other name is still a Nazi. AOS was one of the biggest inspirations for this idea, so I wanted to do justice to its version of Hydra.",

A normal person, in both situations, would easily draw the conclusion to drop either based on their real life actions, no consumer product should mean that much to you that youd be willing to overlook human suffering caused by the individuals behind it, and if it does, make something better that doesnt have the stink attached to it. Thats the reason people like bluesky so much, its basically Twitter before Musk let the sink in.",

I loved Nicholson, Phoenix and Ledger. All great takes on the Joker. I still dont think there has been a perfect live action Joker though. No one has personified him. The actors pull a few threads from the character and build on it but the Joker has too much insanity in his history to carry off what the Joker is and translate it from the comics to the screen. All three of those Joker have been an introduction to the character and amazing in their own rights. Id love to see a Joker done well that when we see him everyone knows that bastard is going to add another cruise ship of dead people to his list because he killed a cruise ship of people last month and the year before it and he launched a mayor into the side of a building with a trebuchet 10 years ago. Its the history behind the character that makes him truly a horror monster but we never got that with the 3 good Joker portrayals. Hamill managed it in BTAS and particularly in the Arkham Games but thats not live action and its easier to build it over years of episodes and pop ins in other media.",

It its awakening was to sap life energy or sentience from those citizens, it should have happened when first awakening and life was already doomed. If it just needed to eat them afterwards, then sentience and science was not needed and raw biomass would have been far larger in earlier eras. And if clawing its way up from the centre of the earth, it hardly matters if it cleared its shoulders above sea level...life is fucked long before it got this high. The massive mantle destruction would have obliterated tectonic plates, the resulting tsunamis would have cleared most coastal life, and the mass release of ashgasocean vapour released through a titanic hole from sea to centre of the earth would have blotted out the sun for decades and lead to immediate ice age. If actually from the centre of core, the moment it started moving all core current was disrupted and the entire electromagnetic corefield collapses and everyone starts getting fried by celestial radiation normal universe type immediately. The entire movie needs to be retconned as a what if because none of this makes any sense. If a celestial emerging is a guaranteed cataclysm them so much as it wiggling would have been catastrophic and its head emerging is end game.",

Having this wasted here, for the first outting of a relatively unknown property, totally bums me out.

Doctor Strange is concerned with supernatural threats. I think the only ones that really patrol would be SpiderMan and some of the Defenders though certainly not all of them. Really just Daredevil and Luke Cage. I think thered be somewhat of a deterrent effect, with crime decreasing gradually due to the presence of heroes. But crime will still exist.

The comic is a major event that effects pretty much every corner of the earth based Marvel comics universe. Everything tied into it. Even though I wasnt as big of a fan of the actual story, it did feel genuinely epic and some of the tie ins were really good. The MCU has way less super powered characters so its not as big of a story. It is still similar to the comic in that it involves everyone on Earth, but its lower scale. However,it is more personal and more narrowly focused, which I really enjoyed. It was much easier for me to get invested in what was going on whereas the comic just felt like a big event with not a lot of substance. The comic tried to explore some really interesting questions about accountability with heroes, but it doesnt really execute it well IMO. Though I havent read it in years and plan on reading it again soon. Complete side note, but the Annihilation storyline happening at the same time on the cosmic side of the Marvel Universe was genuinely very good. I also love the added detail that they cant get any help from the earth based heroes during what is a huge threat to the universe because the earth heroes are all tied up in their civil war.",

Its not Sonys fault that Marvel was going under and had to sell the rights to one of their flagship characters. Thats really the key here though, its one of Marvels flagship characters. So Disney might not be able to afford that, especially as much as theyve set Peter up in the MCU and lost RDJ and Evans. It feels like no one really benefits from this at all.",

I wouldnt be surprised if the kind of debating we see in these comments is happening inside Sony. That said, Im gonna guess 1 of 3 things happens 1. Sony really walks and sits on the IP for a couple years. The wait wont hurt standalone films so much, but kinda screws the MCU release timeline if Spidey really is as integral as we are to believe. If this is the case, then its super unique to see a legal team outfox the Mouse. Sony better be damn sure they dont mess it up by missing some contractual obligation. 2. A new deal is reached this year. The info we have is by its very nature on a bit of a delay, so its very possible the stall is already over and negotiations have already resumed. Both parties had their public pissing contest, then actually got to business compromising, but the doors were closed on us after all the flexing. 3. Sony doesnt budge, Disney finds some contractual BS to take Sony to task, and then offers to buy Spidey outright for insane amounts of money as an out for Sony. Disneys acquisition history is brilliant and dastardly. If Disney managed to find a way to offend Sony into a contract screwup, they could corner them and then force them into take this money and walk away or we beat you legally until you die anyway. Sony is teetering right now in general some very profitable movies, some heavy flops, and being leaned on by Disney is NOT what they need.",

Those resources could have made a 3rd antman movie or a fantastic 4 movie or a ms marvel movie. And so you have 1 movies worth of resources with no financial return beyond your obligate fee that marvel gets for whenever spidey is made. Its not much. So if they want to invest the resources they have to have some sort of cut. And their logic is that they just made Sonys highest grossing film ever and rehabbed the spidey brand and that they could probably do it again and make it bigger. Thats got to be worth more than 5. Its like you asking your boss for a raise because you finished and won a multi billion dollar contract. Your salary is just a drop in the bucket compared to that, but youd probably argue youd want to be compensated fairly.

We watched it later on my TV and it was a way better experience. Anyways, it was a decent film. Not the worst, not the best, it was just okay. If the majority of the cast or characters make it to the MCU, I wouldnt complain.",

On the top of my head, climate change is reducing the lifetime of snow packs snow melts sooner which really hurts Californias and states that receive water from the Colorado River water supply. My personal opinion is that we need to fix and update water laws in the SouthWestern States include Colorado for the sake of simplicity before we begin to think of other solutions.

Silicone is the preferred material for prosthetics, has the most realistic skin texture and a translucency you cant achieve with other materials. It can be heavier on the model, however. You can tint it with flocking like a sort of powdered material to change the base while maintaining translucency. I recommend alcohol based paint for colouring your pieces, and once you get comfortable with silicone you can look into encapsulating silicone to get an even more realistic skin texture. You want to get silicone with a shore strength of 10 for the most realistic look. Best of luck!",

I wouldnt mind it if he were just smart but the world acts like hes perfect when in reality its super easy for him to cross the line into unwitting supervillain.
