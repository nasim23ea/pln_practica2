The internet at large caught on in 1999, just 22 years ago. The word SPAM actually comes from IRC and MUDs we had spam filters long, long before email had spam, thanks to terminal washes and things of that nature. The earliest known IRC spam filter was the anarchy eris.berkeley.edu stripper, which didnt work well enough, and led to the split of Jakkos original network to create erisfree net EFnet is fundamentally named for a spam host removal. If you count the invention of the qline as an antispam strategy, then IRC invents spam filtering in 1991. If you require message or origin testing, IRC invents it in 1992 instead. If youre old enough, you remember when Bayesian Filtering turned spam filtering from an ongoing joke into something that actually worked. This was one of gmails early advantages.",

But for the benefit of your understanding and for others reading, Id take your question as an opportunity to explain this point further. Firstly, nothing in my comment suggested that I thought they were or were not using multilayer perceptrons , even if they were using neural networks or deep learning it would still come under the area of computer vision and not AI. So your rather emphatic focus on MLP multilayer perceptrons doesnt mean anything specifically or validate the stand you are trying to take as to why this should be under AI vs computer vision. AI is an umbrella term that could mean anything. Usually it is used when you have been able to port a supreme level of intelligence into your software or product through a combination of various tasks within various subfields of AI. AI combines areas like Classical Machine Learning, Natural language processing, Computer vision etc, which again can be broken down into tasks like classification, regression classical ML, question answering systems, text summarization, named entity recognition in the case of NLP and object detectionlocalization, object recognition, facial recognition, scene recognition in the case of CV . The reason AI does very little to actually inform readers about what is happening is because it could mean anything right from a heuristic based system to deep learning and it also doesnt give a clear idea of the kind of data that was used to generate a result. The way to describe work in the field is to mention the particular tasks used to achieve an objective , like object detection, facial recognition in this case. Instead of saying AI. For additional reference, please take a look at this collection of papers and how they describe the various tasks   A very common misrepresentation is when people use Machine learning and AI interchangeably. Machine learning is a subset of AI and isnt equivalent to AI. Now, riddle me this, does netflix use AI? Or recommender systems?",

If all it takes for a learning process to be humanlike is to learn by examples and change internal information, then linear regression and naïve Bayes must qualify as humanlike too.

How can I be apart of the change that results in something better? Sure, read more papers, be better at research, be more creative, blah blah blah, descriptors that are easy for the experienced to understand and impossible for the young and learning to interpret. The reason that science seems to be only nudged by the many and truly pushed by the few is because, in my opinion, success is hardly documented and faults and critism are plentiful. I think if more were willing to mentor, teach and share then we could see more progress. I know I could be better. Finally, we need a less hand wavy approach to learning how to research.

        "score": 3901,
        "description": "It is omnipresent! First of all, the peerreview process is broken. Every fourth NeurIPS submission is put on arXiv. There are DeepMind researchers publicly going after reviewers who are criticizing their ICLR submission. On top of that, papers by wellknown institutes that were put on arXiv are accepted at top conferences, despite the reviewers agreeing on rejection. In contrast, vice versa, some papers with a majority of accepts are overruled by the AC. I dont want to call any names, just have a look the openreview page of this years ICRL. Secondly, there is a reproducibility crisis. Tuning hyperparameters on the test set seem to be the standard practice nowadays. Papers that do not beat the current stateoftheart method have a zero chance of getting accepted at a good conference. As a result, hyperparameters get tuned and subtle tricks implemented to observe a gain in performance where there isnt any. Thirdly, there is a worshiping problem. Every paper with a Stanford or DeepMind affiliation gets praised like a breakthrough. For instance, BERT has seven times more citations than ULMfit. The Google affiliation gives so much credibility and visibility to a paper. At every ICML conference, there is a crowd of people in front of every DeepMind poster, regardless of the content of the work. The same story happened with the Zoom meetings at the virtual ICLR 2020. Moreover, NeurIPS 2020 had twice as many submissions as ICML, even though both are toptier ML conferences. Why? Why is the name neural praised so much? Next, Bengio, Hinton, and LeCun are truly deep learning pioneers but calling them the godfathers of AI is insane. It has reached the level of a cult. Fourthly, the way Yann LeCun talked about biases and fairness topics was insensitive. However, the toxicity and backlash that he received are beyond any reasonable quantity. Getting rid of LeCun and silencing people wont solve any issue. Fifthly, machine learning, and computer science in general, have a huge diversity problem. At our CS faculty, only 30 of undergrads and 15 of the professors are women. Going on parental leave during a PhD or postdoc usually means the end of an academic career. However, this lack of diversity is often abused as an excuse to shield certain people from any form of criticism. Reducing every negative comment in a scientific discussion to race and gender creates a toxic environment. People are becoming afraid to engage in fear of being called a racist or sexist, which in turn reinforces the diversity problem. Sixthly, moral and ethics are set arbitrarily. The U.S. domestic politics dominate every discussion. At this very moment, thousands of Uyghurs are put into concentration camps based on computer vision algorithms invented by this community, and nobody seems even remotely to care. Adding a broader impact section at the end of every people will not make this stop. There are huge shitstorms because a researcher wasnt mentioned in an article. Meanwhile, the 1billion people continent of Africa is virtually excluded from any meaningful ML discussion besides a few Indaba workshops. Seventhly, there is a cutthroat publishorperish mentality. If you dont publish 5 NeurIPSICML papers per year, you are a looser. Research groups have become so large that the PI does not even know the name of every PhD student anymore. Certain people submit 50 papers per year to NeurIPS. The sole purpose of writing a paper has become to having one more NeurIPS paper in your CV. Quality is secondary passing the peerpreview stage has become the primary objective. Finally, discussions have become disrespectful. Schmidhuber calls Hinton a thief, Gebru calls LeCun a white supremacist, Anandkumar calls Marcus a sexist, everybody is under attack, but nothing is improved. Albert Einstein was opposing the theory of quantum mechanics Can we please stop demonizing those who do not share our exact views. We are allowed to disagree without going for the jugular. The moment we start silencing people because of their opinion is the moment scientific and societal progress dies. Best intentions, Yusuf",

I started doing scientific research because I imagined the system to be a fair meritocracy. Its science after all. If you dont like politics, academia is one of the worst places to be. This is the sad truth. This is not a recent phenomenon, and its not just ML. It has always been this way. Its just more visible now because more people are new to the field and surprised that its not what they expected. As long as the academic system functions the way it does and is protected by gatekeepers and institutions with perverse incentives, this will never change. What can you do? Lead by example. Dont play the game and exit the system. Do independent research. Do something else. Dont be driven by your ego that tells you to compete with other academics and publish more papers. Do real stuff. Its very difficult to reform a system from within. Reform comes when enough people decide to completely exit a system and build an alternative that has a critical mass.",

                "comentario": "I would suggest the following to solve some of the issues. aCommunity moderation on arxiv  We have upvotes, downvotes, comments, and ranking by hot, top, controversial on reddit and mods. This to a large extent enables reddit to be a place where you can voice your thoughts but someone can step in if a situation arises. I remember there was this huge backlash on a recent paper that talked about face detection to identify criminal behaviour. The authors were kind enough to retract their submission. Imagine if they had posted it on arxiv, was there anything anyone could have done about it? bSet guidelines for arxiv Imagine you get to review a paper but find out that it is from Geoff Hinton, or Yann LeCun.. would you be able to review it in an unbiased fashion? Maybe the authors could upload a blinded submission to arxiv and reveal the names once a they decide to stop targetting a publication b the draft gets accepted. cMake Codes mandatory The policy of coderelease being optional was largely derived from the systems community where releasing the code meant revealing a lot of properiatary IPs standardcell libraries cost billions to model, RTL IP licenses were what earned companies money..however even they have started gravitating towards opensource if anyone is interested RISCV, tiny compiler by Austin Henley, JOS by MIT are great starting points however, AI has started to go the other way, fortunately there are voices speaking out against it. d Make ethics compulsory There is this famous quote by Oppenheimer after they invented the Atom bomb I am become death, the destroyer of worlds. AI researchers need to understand this quote applies a lot to them. The Atom Bomb killed around 126K people lowest estimate in a matter of minutes..Prior to that, if someone had to kill around 126K people, they would need an army that was at least twice that size and would need to fight for at least 20 months US lost around 6,600 people a month during the war. Similarly, research that took around monthsyears can now be done in minutesdays. This is a tremendous amount of power and people who wield it can shape our future. It is thus important to focus on the ethics of AI rather than look at pure accuracy numbers. e Better metrics Increasingly there are models that are able to beat SOTA due to their sheer size. Take BERT for example, Do you think colleges in Africa, Asia would be able to afford the compute costs? How about we rank models based on cost in terms of power consumed, in terms of money  and not just based on accuracy?. f While I might disagree with some of the language used by Gebru. She has a point. In an increasingly competitive world, if we choose not to stand up for those who do not have a voice, we are choosing to ignore their views and are complicit in silencing them. PhDs are toxic and cutthroat and AI research is even more so. My girlfriend was forced to walk out of a project for speaking out against harassment because the harasser was intelligent. If people like Gebru are silenced, people like my girlfriend are the ones who will have to pay the price. I would highly recommend watching the documentary called disclosure on netflix to understand the consequences of ignoring someones perspective. If Gebru hadnt spoken out against racism and the danger of facial recognition algorithms, we would still be having companies like clearview.ai mining our data for surveillance. g Understand privilege This is something ALL AI and Security researchers need to understand. If you are a researcher publishing one or two papers in AI or Security, you have some degree of privilege. Think about what you need to know to be a decent AI researcher today A fair deal of programming, linear algebra, probability, good vocabulary, free time to keep up with deluge of papers in your field, a good peer group to discuss and brainstorm ideas, and finally resources to conduct experiments. ALL of this is privilege. So when someone is trying to point out an issue, maybe we can listen.. and yes, sometimes the issue may not be presented correctly or the person might use language that we cannot stomach. But the question we must ask ourselves is What are we losing by just listening to the other person?.",

                "comentario": "That seems like a really big claim. I think the first piece, is separating the problem statement from the proposed solutions. Is there a problem with some form of systemic bias in research? Studies like this one to me says that yes, its likely. In Orchestras at least, this says that gender does have a direct causal impact on acceptance probabilities. I also imagine the people holding auditions would all truly believe theyre unbiased, which certainly makes things even more complicated. So... is there a problem with bias in the research community? Given the fact that demographics there doesnt even remotely match general population demographics, and given cases like the study above from other industries that showed a clear bias, it seems likely to me that some people who should be allowed in given their merit may not be able to. But heres the followup question that I think youre actually wondering about was the right way to get more women in the orchestra to have a requirement that you have a certain  of players from each demographic? Would you dilute the talent of the orchestra if you did that? I doubt that solution would be anywhere near as good as the blind auditions. So... even if there is a problem, obviously not all solutions are equal. Some probably would dilute the talent pool. Others would probably greatly strengthen it. The idea that not a single possible diversity centered improvement could do anything other than dilute the talent though, to me shows a profound lack of imagination.",

Indeed in my department I think anyone would be way better off not being in one of the big ML groups, and working under another advisor with a smaller group not too small though because that means the prof is hard to work with or doesnt have enough money. My impression is that these giant groups are miserable to work in, highly competitive even within a competitive grad program, and run by senior grad students or post docs so you wont even get to work with the famous prof, its just a nice line on your resume. But many advisors not in ML would be happy for their students to apply ML to their research, so there is really no need to be in one of those groups unless you feel it is really important to you. You should try to find an advisor that is willing to let you explore your interests, easy to work with, and has the time and money to support you. When you do campus visits, the most important thing is asking students in different groups how happy they are with their advisor. TLDR dont choose a famous ML advisorat least know what youre getting into. But work on ML anyway if it interests you.",

I wish all people crying about female underrepresentation would notice that its not usually about sexism in CS field but more about this stupid nerdy loser with social anxiety stereotype that is unattractive to people and obviously false. But, as you said, this is a highschool problem Id even say that an elementaryschool one. I really cant understand why people behind all these promotional programs are so focused on fighting sexism for the good of young girls but at the same time they seem like they havent even asked these girls what the real problem is.

Something like the infamous LeCun thread might be a bit sensitive I think as long as you do not ignore the context and address the problems in both sides of the conversation, it shouldnt be a problem. Anyone trying to troll people for that should definitely be called out. 2. Fair point. Generalizing someones character based on one statement is definitely wrong. Whenever there is such sexism or racism spotted, it should be us calling out that behavior rather than running to put stickers on the speaker. At the same time, accusing the person calling it out as being disrespectful or emotional shifts the focus of the discussion away from the real issue.",

If what OP says is true, that Gebru called LeCun a white supremacist, thats quite different and crosses a line if substantial evidence is missing. When I conduct archival research and write about historical figures, I dont use that word lightly.

At the top of this thread, a user is claiming Fei Fei Li has invented nothing. Ive heard countless stories of sexual harassment despite attending an engineering school that is 50 women MIT. Women in certain departments have been ranked by hotness in the past. There is a consistent doubting of technical skill based on nothing other than gender, from middle school to tenuretrack. This before even analyzing the historic enforcement of gender norms. Edit also, not to be an asshole but you have over 420 posts on incel subreddits like rbraincels and rincelswithouthate...

How someone can do things like this and be a director at Nvidia and have 30k followers is beyond me. Edit Apparently he isnt a high school student, sorry for the mistake. My point was mainly that public figures shouldnt make personal attacks on young researchers, or anybody for that matter. To put it another way imagine if a white male researcher called a young female researcher an idiot on a public forum. Many including myself would find that to be unacceptable.

First of all, the syntax of languages differs greatly, for example English is Subject Verb Object so we figure out whos doing a thing at the start of a sentence, and find out what its been done to at the end. This differs from languages like Korean wherein you dont figure out whos doing something until the end. This can pose a challenge to realtime translation, as to the other listener your sentences would sound unnatural. Furthermore, the greatest accuracy for the sentence, accounting for homonyms etc, will be once all of the inputs are collected, the correct transforms applied, optimizations created and then rendering. TLDR Fast realtime  less accurate. Product demos require accuracy or people will tear you apart for even the smallest trifles, so slow and accurate is better here.",

Theres a reason why fringe groups like TERFs, COVID deniers, Nazis and other conspiracy groups have a stronger foothold on Facebook than they do on sites like Reddit. Facebook drags its feet on implementing any proper moderation of their platform and actively expands into areas like Myanmar where they didnt even have the necessary support resources to do so. A single Burmese speaking moderator isnt equipped to enforce site rules on a population of 54 million. It was a relatively big story a while back that Facebook wouldnt even remove Holocaust denial content unless they feared action from countries with laws on it. Facebook knows conflict drives engagement on their platform. Theyve also been fairly complacent to allowing their services to be exploited by political campaigns, most notably the Cambridge Analytica and Duterte election scandals. Some of its likely not even intentional and driven by algorithmns. Youtubes alt right pipeline is probably a famous example of an algorithmic bias that pushes people towards hateful material simply because the algorithmn deems it more engaging to users than regular content.",

They have abandoned this idea entirely. Today, with the release of GPT4 and their direct statement that they will not release details of the model creation due to safety concerns and the competitive environment, they have created a precedent worse than those that existed before they entered the field. Were at risk now of other major players, who previously at least published their work and contributed to open source tools, close themselves off as well. AI alignment is a serious issue that we definitely have not solved. Its a huge field with a dizzying array of ideas, beliefs and approaches. Were talking about trying to capture the interests and goals of all humanity, after all. In this space, the one approach that is horrifying and the one that OpenAI was LITERALLY created to prevent is a singular or oligarchy of for profit corporations making this decision for us. This is exactly what OpenAI plans to do. I get it, GPT4 is incredible. However, we are talking about the single most transformative technology and societal change that humanity has ever made. It needs to be for everyone or else the average person is going to be left behind. We need to unify around open source development choose companies that contribute to science, and condemn the ones that dont. This conversation will only ever get more important.",

I would not be surprised if this gets upped to an even further extreme I can imagine in the not so far future we get heres an API, its for GPTN, heres its benchmarks, and thats all you need to know.

What about the hungry novicesnewcomersanyone curious who have a slight CS background or less, but have never had the resources previously to utilize models in their applications or workflows? As we can all see with the flood of posts of the heres my blahblahblah using ChatGPT or How do I train LLama on my phone? variety to any relevant sub, the novice user group is getting bigger day by day. Will they be aware and caring enough to boycott closed modeling practices? Or will they disregard that for the pursuit of moneynotoriety, hoping their application takes off? I think I know the answer. ML technology is reaching the threshold that and I feel sick making the comparison crypto did in terms of accessibility a few years back, for better or worse. Meaning there will always be new people wanting to utilize these tools who dont care about trainingproductionizing a model, just that it works as advertised. Right now, I dont think?

If they dont, they will quickly find that there are no other peers Google, OpenAI, etc. who will publicly push the research envelope with them, and I dont think they want to nor have the commercial incentives to go it alone 3 You will probably unless openai gets its way with regulationFUD...which it very well may see increased government support for capitalintensive training research and, 4 Honestly, everyone owes OpenAI a giant thankyou for productizing LLMs. If not for OpenAI and its smaller competitors, wed all be staring dreamily at vague Google press releases about how they have AGI in their backyard but need to spend another undefined number of years considering the safety implications of actually shipping a useful product. The upshot of this is that there are huge dollars flowing into AIML that net are positive for virtually everyone who frequents this message board minus AGI accelerationist doomers, of course. The above all said... There is obviously a question of equilibrium. If, e.g., things move really fast, then you could see a world where Alphabet, OpenAI, and a small  of others are so far out ahead that they just suck all of the oxygen out of the roomincluding govt dollars think the history of government support for aerospace RD, e.g.. Now, the last silver lining, if you are concerned about OpenAI I think there is a big open question of if and how OpenAI can stay out ahead. To date, they have very, very heavily stood on the shoulders of Alphabet, Meta, and a few others. This is not to understate the work they have doneparticularly on the engineering sidebut it is easy to underestimate how hard and meandering core RD is. If Alphabet, e.g., stops sharing their progress freely, how long will OpenAI be able to stay out ahead, on a product level? OpenAI is extremely well funded, but basic research is extremely hard to do, and extremely hard to accelerate with just buckets of cash. Additionally, as others have pointed out elsewhere, basic research is also extremely leaky. If they manage to conjure up some deeply unique insights, someone like Amazon will trivially dangle some 8figure pay packages to catch up cf. the far less useful selfdriving cars talent wars. Now, if you somehow see OpenAI moving RD out of CA and into states with harsher noncompete policies, a la most quant funds...then maybe you should worry... Lastly, if you hold the view that the bitter lesson video, synthetic world simulations is really the solution to all our problems, then maybe OpenAI doesnt need to do much basic research, and this is truly an engineering problem. But if that is the case, the barrier is mostly capital and engineering smarts, which will not be a meaningful impediment to toptier competitors, if they truly are on the AGI roadtogold. tldr I think the market will probably smooth things out over the next few years...unless were somehow on a rapid escape velocity for the singularity.",

But its not an xrisk. And its harmful to at least some peoples mental health that it being an xrisk is the impression one gets from the culture, probably. TBF convincing people that AGI is an xrisk is probably also not helpful, given that theres no effective solution to the problem anyway.",

Theres also the fact that higher framerates require much brighter lighting in general to reduce any chance of unintended blur, which can drastically increase production time and significantly change the initially intended look of a film... or require much more postproduction to achieve the vision of the director. If animation started using more 4860120fps, Id fully understand as its much easier to control the environment and everything in every shot... but live action is either going to take a while to warm to the idea of HFR or never fully adopt anything higher than 24fps as a standard. I guess well see if others take the lead from James Cameron after Avatar 2 is finally released, but were more likely to just see a gimmicky period of more movies at high frame rates just like there was a big postAvatar 3D boom.",

The impact each frame gives can change, and some low framerate content like Anime is made with regard to low framerate. Not that anime shouldnt be higher framerate, but its hard to interpolate and work to draw 60 fps is very expensive. However, on the other hand, it can really improve many things. I was at a friends place and we watch a movie on the TV and I could see interpolation artifacts on a movie mostly quick action scenes, were camera flicks around, so not that big of deal but turning the feature off made it near unwatchable. I watch movies all the time on my PC, but that playback was painful. And I love making some content high framerate, just because its smoother. From my own experience, the real flaws show with small objects, large movements of the framescameraobjects, and rapid changes. I tried some interpolation on gameplay, and with mouse and keyboard in a first person shooter, the interpolation cant keep up at all. Noticed things like grenades, small ones, that might move relatively far with just one frame at even 60 fps, is going to be a problem for motion estimation methods. Also, yeah, SVP at least uses motion vectors iirc, but not machine learning. I think such methods are faster, and results are near as good as a decent machine learning network. Perhaps better since TVs do so well without significant artifacts",

Though PSNR shouldnt be used anymore to present results 1st plot. Also Im not sure that youre using FP16, you could probably try that to speed up even more the computations. You used SSIM and you should try LPIPS. I manage to see some artifacts on this video and I guess these examples arent random and were chosen because thats where the algorithm worked the best. To be used in the real world youtube  tv  film industry, having a fast algorithm is necessary but there probably shouldnt be almost any artifacts for all kind of footages. If I had to wait x2 but with 0 artifacts, I would probably try a slower version.",

                "comentario": "I mean the _reality_ is like infinity FPS and 60 fps is closer to infinity than 25. What we feel of it in the eye may happen at some lower frequency, but then again people are easily able to distinguish between 30 fps game or 60 fps game.. No matter what digital processing tricks are used, in general case but not in all cases, like slowly moving objects. Are people really able to distinguish between material that has been downsampled to 30 fps from 60 fps, instead of directly filmed to 30 fps? I suppose if it was just about motion blur then it would be easy to fix with some digital signal processing even preserving the frame rate.. and I have doubts it would do it. For example one comment I remember hearing is that the legs seemed to move too quickly in LoTR HFR, while, I imagine, the legs were moving at exactly the correct rate. Being a film maker you might be aware of the old idea of supporting variable frame rate in movies  . I imagine that would be best of both worlds. In particular I would enjoy experiencing the jarring 24 fps panorama scrolls in higher frame ratealthough this is something that automatic interpolation handles well. In my opinion the bigger the change of frames in your field of view is, the worse the low frame rate feels. It also remains to be seen if the current gaming generation will also start to prefer higher frame rate videos due to exposure you mentionnot just games, but Youtube also supports 60 fps. I have a 180 degree stereo VR camera and I feel 30 fps just doesnt cut it when putting the VR glasses on. In my case I need to choose between 5.6k30 fps and 4k60 fps and most often I choose the latter, even if the picture quality would be a bit better in the former.",

It works more than good enough if you arent looking for artifacts, or simply dont care, the gains are simply worth more than the losses. Particularly cost.

You dont have to own a 4k camera to make 4k content. 100 camera that can do 1080  60hz, can be upscaled to 4k and 120hz in post.

        "description": "Hello there, rMachineLearning, Recently, Reddit has announced some changes to their API that may have pretty serious impact on many of its users. You may have already seen quite a few posts like these across some of the other subreddits that you browse, so were just going to cut to the chase.  Whats Happening Third Party Reddit apps such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun and others are going to become ludicrously more expensive for its developers to run, which will in turn either kill the apps, or result in a monthly fee to the users if they choose to use one of those apps to browse. Put simply, each request to Reddit within these mobile apps will cost the developer money. The developers of Apollo were quoted around 2 million per month for the current rate of usage. The only way for these apps to continue to be viable for the developer is if you the user pay a monthly fee, and realistically, this is most likely going to just outright kill them. Put simply If you use a third party app to browse Reddit, you will most likely no longer be able to do so, or be charged a monthly fee to keep it viable. In lieu of whats happening, an open letter has been released by the broader moderation community. Part of this initiative includes a potential subreddit blackout meaning, the subreddit will be privatized on June 12th, lasting 2448 hours or longer. On one hand, this is great to hopefully make enough of an impact to influence Reddit to change their minds on this. On the other hand, we usually stay out of these blackouts, and we would rather not negatively impact usage of the subreddit. We would like to give the community a voice in this. Is this an important enough matter that rmachinelearning should fully support the protest and blackout the subreddit on June 12th? Feel free to leave your thoughts and opinions below. Also, please use updownvotes for this submission to make yourself heard upvote rML should join the protest, downvote rML should not join the protest.",

                "comentario": "As I am such a Reddit noob, I dont know enough about how people have innovated on top of it, but I cant imagine it being on the same scale as twitter. Let me put it like this, most people who are up in arms about this are using third party apps. Those apps use said API. The prices for using the API that reddit is proposing are not at all reasonable  the Apollo dev has calculated that an average Apollo user would have to bring in 20x more money than reddit total current revenue  active overall reddit users  i.e. apollo users would bring in 20x as much money as other users. Demanding some amount of money is fair, considering reddit might not be able to show ads in those apps. As for what kind of innovation? Its more about the innovation that hasnt happened. Reddits redesign and its app are  in my mind  barely usable because they focus on the wrong thing. It refocuses the user experience in a direction I dont like, towards shallower engagement. Its an app optimized towards engagement and platform traffic, not towards whatever goals I have. With a thirdparty app, I can tailor the experience to my needs. Also keep in mind that reddits moderation is almost entirely done by unpaid volunteer moderators. Their tools rely on this API. So now theyre supposed to pay for the privilege of working for reddit? I think not. Moderation has long been a sore spot, as I feel that most of the issues we experience with subpar moderation are just to do with the workload of these unpaid volunteers. Reddit has failed to address that for years now. Instead, they drive out the veteran power users. It would be an entirely different matter if the pricing of the API was reasonable. If I could pay for an app that does what I want, and reddit gets a big part of that for providing the platform, Id be game. But the price just isnt reasonable. 12 cent per month is fair, 2.50 per month isnt.",

Edit Just got back from the library reading about Gaussian random processes and I see that Reddit downvoted me. Typical. Is it because I am saying something positive about Siraj and am violating le Redditor groupthink? Or maybe because my credentials far surpass yours and you are intimidatedenvious of my experience and intellectual prowess?",

Like most men, I had the problem of too many women asking for my dick pics. So I spent the last 2 years learning linear algebra, Bayesian statistics, and multivariable calculus so that I could finally keep up with the demand by generating thousands of fake penises with AI. The above website features those thousands of penises, do with it what you will. If youre curious about the machine learning, the training dataset consisted of 40k dick pics from Reddit. Specifically the subreddits rpenis rcock, rdicks, raveragepenis, rMassiveCock, and rtinydick to keep it well rounded. I then cleaned the dataset by training a Mask RCNN Model to segment out the penis, used PCA on the segment to find the tilt of the shaft, then rotated the image so the schlong was aligned with the vertical axis. The images were then put into a StyleGAN2  and trained for 9 days on a TPUv38. The dataset, in case you want to see what 42,273 dick pics look like is posted in the Github.",

When the pictures were scraped, the subjects could be anywhere in the image and often times they were in different locations, distances, and orientations. This was an issue so I trained a mask RCNN model to detect the subjects. Next, I used rotations and scaling to position the subject as close to a defined position as it could be. If they keep pushing, just start describing them well, each subject is a cylindrical object of a varying size and you can offer more details if they STILL dont stop asking well, the height of each cylinder is around 4 inches on average but its highly skewed to larger length due to the bias in the data",

Same as cut ones as someone below posted. Like the model has more points of delineation in those images and can then use those as references.

But a lot of the work is just computer based CAD, documentation, collaborative work so Id expect that to be pretty remote. Also Apple has a lot of silicon devs which can do their work 100 remote from the other side of the country. So its an odd policy, and one that could easily hurt them in the long term.",

Another few companies where I have the inside scoop all far far smaller than Apple it is the micromanagers who really are demanding a return to the office while the more productive employees have been revelling in the general lack of interruptions. This is not 100 the case as many a micromanager has done their damnedest to have endless quantities of endless zoom meetings. But on that I have heard some organizations were better able to get a grip on those few managers time wasting as there was now a solid record and people could start doing the math 8 people paid 100 per hour with 3 meetings per day for a manager totalling 24 man hours per day at 2400 or 12,000 per week of meetings. And that is if they are 100 per hour employees. Often tech people are more expensive plus many of those hours are either not productive and possibly not billable. Thus a single micromanager only having 3 hours of meetings per day could be costing no less than 600k per year and possibly millions. One company I worked at had one magical micromanger who had about 6 hours of meeting with 38 people in those meetings so he was definitely in the over 1 million zone. I was in an entirely different department and he was regularly inviting me to various meetings and trying to give me grief for not coming. He was shocked when I told him one day, Look, if you ever manage to convince someone to force me to go to any meeting of yours or report to you in any way, I will walk out the front door of this company and not look back. On a side note he asked more than one person in the company if a recent quit might have been due to him. I learned from that company a really cool financial analysis tool count the meeting rooms as a ratio to employees count the ratio of managers to the number of developers. Super bright red flags if either of these numbers get too high.",

        "description": "As you may already know Apple is going to implement NeuralHash algorithm for ondevice CSAM detection soon. Believe it or not, this algorithm already exists as early as iOS 14.3, hidden under obfuscated class names. After some digging and reverse engineering on the hidden APIs I managed to export its model which is MobileNetV3 to ONNX and rebuild the whole NeuralHash algorithm in Python. You can now try NeuralHash even on Linux! Source code  No preexported model file will be provided here for obvious reasons. But its very easy to export one yourself following the guide I included with the repo above. You dont even need any Apple devices to do it. Early tests show that it can tolerate image resizing and compression, but not cropping or rotations. Hope this will help us understand NeuralHash algorithm better and know its potential issues before its enabled on all iOS devices. Happy hacking!",

You cant do that if you hash it. It is mathematically impossible to create a perceptual hash that always produces exactly the same hash for minor alterations of the input image. This is trivially provable by a threshold argument make minuscule changes to the input images until a bit flips you can narrow this down to changing a single pixel brightness by one, which is the smallest possible change. So you always need to match with some threshold of allowed bits that differ. Even just running NeuralHash on the same image on different devices, as shown in TFA, can actually cause the output to differ in a large number of bits 9 in the example. Thats actually really bad, and makes this much worse than a trivial perceptual image hash. In case youre having any ideas of the match threshold being small enough to allow a bruteforce search against a cryptographic hash, this invalidates that idea 96 choose 9 is a 12digit number of attempts youd have to make just to even match the same exact image on different devices.

Edit Actually, reading Apples document about this in more detail, they do claim the NeuralHashes have to be  are identical for similar images. Since this is mathematically impossible and trivially proven wrong even by just the rounding issues the OP demonstrates NeuralHash actually performs worse here than a typical perceptual hash due to the error amplification, Apple are either lying or their system is broken and doesnt actually work as advertised. The reality is that obviously NeuralHashes have to be compared with a threshold, but the system that Apple describes would require exact matches. It sounds to me like some ML engineer at Apple tried to throw neural networks at this problem, without understanding why it cannot be fundamentally solved due to basic mathematics.

They say there is a 1 in a trillion 1012 chance of someone being flagged incorrectly. That means there is a known false positive rate, FPR, and FPR301012. That implies that the chance that any one of those 30 pictures is a false positive is about 40. So a very liberal threshold. BUT  each of those matches came after scanning your whole library. If you have 1000 pictures, the chance that any individual picture would match is the 30th root of 1FPR, which would be about .983, or a 1.17 chance any given picture would be flagged. NOTE  yes, this is a gross oversimplification, because each of the 30 matches comes from scanning the SAME 1000 pictures. So theres a 1000 choose 30 in there somewhere. And photographs is a VERY tiny and biased subset of all the possible rectangular sets of pixel values you might encounter. So the per picture FPR is certainly lower than this, but whatever the number is, its probably much higher than youd guess off the bat. My point is that by requiring 30 pictures to match, you can be pretty lax about flagging any particular picture, so the match criteria are probably weak, not strong.",

So on the user side, your image is put through the feature extraction network the neural network and those features are hashed into the NeuralHash. The interesting thing is that apple takes your neural hash and does a row lookup on the CSAM hash DB and encrypts your payload with the CSAM blinded hash at that row location. Once your encrypted image is uploaded with a header that is your Neuralhash, on the server side, that neuralhash is put through the blinding algorithm which produces the blinded hash for your uploaded image. It then attempts to decrypt your payload using your blinded hash. If what you upload is CSAM material, your blinded hash will match the blinded hash that was used to encrypt your payload, and it will result in a positive match. Sorry if I didnt do my best explaining, but its all quite technical. Again, please watch Yannic Kilchers video, he does a wonderful job of explaining it",

The same pdata is then sent to all clients in the world as part of an OS software update. However, later in that section it says Whenever the client receives a new triple tr  y, id, ad it uses pdata to construct a short voucher Vtr, and sends Vtr to the server. No other communication is allowed between the client and the server... When a voucher is first received at the server, the server processes it and marks it as nonmatching, if that voucher was computed from a non matching hash value. So Apple is distributing something to every phone, but as far as I can tell that thing isnt a database of known CSAM perceptual hashes, its a cryptographically transformed and unrecoverable version of the database thats only useful for constructing vouchers. When Apple receives the voucher, they can verify whether the perceptual hash of the image used to create the voucher is a fuzzy perceptual hash match to any known CSAM image, but they cant recover the perceptual hash of the image itself A malicious server must learn nothing about the clients Y beyond the output of ftPSIAD with respect to this set X.",

As a side note, I still dont know why people seem to keep insisting that only perfect tools are useful. I also dont know why anyone would use any single source of information as the only source of information. If something really is important to know accurately, you should be looking at dozens of sources. AI is just a quick and direct way to get started researching something by helping to identify where further investigation is needed. Personally, I have never used ChatGPT for providing me with facts. Ive used it mostly as a tool for brainstorming ideas by bouncing hypothetical questions off of it and considering its responses. For example, asking it to come up with rules for a game called Quantum Backgammon, where it suggested pieces can have a superposition of simultaneously occupying multiple places on the board until their waveform collapses to resolve their exact location, or using entanglement to link pieces together. Sometimes, it comes up with some idea that I would not have considered.",

With regards to summarizing code though Im surprised nobody from the comments has made any comments about the AST.

The concepts and ideas behind DL, GANs, LSTMs, CNNs, whatever  its clear, its simple, its intuitive. The slog is to go through the jargon that keeps changing beneath your feet  whats the point of using fancy words if you cant keep them consistent?, the unnecessary equations, trying to squeeze meaning from bullshit language used in papers, figuring out the super important steps, preprocessing, hyperparameters optimization that the authors, oops, failed to mention. Sorry for singling out, but look at this  what the fuck? If a developer anywhere else at Facebook would get this code for a review they would throw up.  Do you intentionally try to obfuscate your papers? Is pseudocode a fucking premium? Can you at least try to give some intuition before showering the reader with equations?  How the fuck do you dare to release a paper without source code?  Why the fuck do you never ever add comments to you code?  When naming things, are you charged by the character? Do you get a bonus for acronyms?  Do you realize that OpenAI having needed to release a baseline TRPO implementation is a fucking disgrace to your profession?

A couple of years back, releasing code with the paper was a completely foreign concept to the field, and thus we had to manually request the authors to provide their internal code to be able to benchmark against, or use their systems. In most cases, such a request was denied had a couple of personal experiences too, and we had to write things from scratch, which slowed down the entire research process. At the moment, Im really grateful that companies and research groups are releasing their superefficient and superuseful libraries like Tensorflow, PyTorch, DyNet et al and now even useful wrappers like Seq2Seq, TFFold etc. Trust me, it has always been easy to come up with new ideas in the field, but it was really hard to quickly benchmark them a couple of years back. The time that I have to invest to understand their code is way lesser than the time that it would take me to write good implementations of tricky architectures for instance, Memory Networks, Neural Turing Machines from scratch. Sure, things can improve, but if that improvement comes at the cost of the research groups not releasing that code because of bad quality, I would rather have them release it nevertheless and clean it up myself.",

They take CS courses that are only partly related to actual programming, then go to grad school where there is even less emphasis on programming. You end up with people who are nominal experts in their field but couldnt code themselves out of a wet paper bag. And their code quality is exactly what youd expect, low quality, spaghetti, poor variable naming, poor abstraction, little documentation, little consistency, etc. Whereas perhaps before the dot com boom, by the time most of those people made it to undergrad, they had already been programming for years. Academics these days are very much like a fresh grad student entering the workforce, except they dont, and so their code quality remains at that level for years and years because there is no pressure to write better code.",

Research code, by its nature, needs to get thrown away and rewritten far more often than production code. You try something for a few hours, a day, or a week, it doesnt work, you throw away much of it and keep a bit, and you repeat. I cant tell you how many times I made the mistake of refactoring myself into a hole, simply because things evolve fast enough that writing proper abstractions and iterating them to follow the research is a burden. Note that this doesnt apply as strongly to ML engineering, where projects are better defined, goals are more concrete, and less of the work is research. Since research works with ideas rather than code, code nor even the text of a paper isnt the end goal. Youre merely translating the ideas into natural language and code. About your comments on papers themselves. Unnecessary equations? Im not sure why youre complaining about whats typically the most precise way to communicate an idea. Papers also tend to be brief because of page limits, and also the need to balance the main content with related work, background, etc. Most of your concerns dont apply to the bestwritten papers. But those are rare, just as highquality software projects are. If you value highquality ML code, why not contribute? Refactorrewrite a fork and document it, release useful libraries, start a blog about implementing algorithms, etc. Clearly peopled appreciate all of these.

                "comentario": "I think this question is actually is quite interesting if one instead views it as how one could try to apply best practices from software engineering to improving machine learning research. I should probably add that I am very far from being a researcher in ML but is probably more well versed in standard software engineering. Anyway, in my experience the speed at which requirements change when doing experiments in for example ML cannot be compared to traditional software development, and I think this is probably one of the most important underlying factors for the current situation. At least in the experiments Ive been doing I find myself more or less constantly having to rework the basic control flow of the application, and traditional software engineering practices seems to be of limited value. I dont have any particular example of this unfortunately, but I think its something like one comes in with the assumption that one might be interested in how some parameter affects the outcome, and then after doing some experiments one figures out one is actually interested in some other parameter one had no idea about when starting out, and this is now very hard to change in some clean way. Well, parameters in this paragraph might not be the right word, if it was just a single number it would be trivial to write the experiments so they are all tunable, but instead it is rather entire subsystems. In the web application one usually has a very static structure with different modules passing information in a way that will basically never change throughout the lifetime of the application, and then some configurable bits between these modules. One might have some basic layer responsible for routing a request to the correct controller, and then controller doing its stuff and interacting with the models and then handing the request off the the view, and so on. If the web developers on a daily basis had this fundamental structure of the application challenged I think that code would be quite a mess as well. My point here is not that all hope is lost, software engineering in traditional fields have taken a long time to develop and something as simple as MVC was figured out fairly recently, in the grand scheme of things. Instead my point is that there are some real difficulties in this area, and just saying that the ML community does not follow good software engineering practices seems to miss many important points. Finally, this answer has not addressed why the final product is not polished and refactored into a more understandable style, but I think many others have addressed this part of the problem.",

For an experimental machine learning system, its often duct taped together, with various parts dangling off in ways you hadnt expected as you try to bridge the space between the complexities of the world and the computer. Usually, what works barely works. Like pdehaans comment, it should be better, but at the moment its not, and in doing bleeding edge research, its hard to spend time making things nice.",

What I do not understand is why would anyone not publish their source code. Its literally a few clicks away from uploading it to GitHub. Whats more, without the code, theres actually no proof that the method described in the paper works. The authors could just as well make up a bunch of numbers showing that their method is slightly superior to all other stateoftheart how I hate that expression methods, but without the source code provided, there is no way of making sure they are not making stuff up. Thus, when trying to overcome a certain method, I have to reimplement it first. During that process, I am likely to make a few mistakes, since the paper did not bother to mention a few details. Then, my own method defeats my implementation of someone elses method only due to a few bugs I would have not made had the original authors published their source code for comparison. Even if the published source code is of horrible quality, its still better than nothing and can serve as a reference during my own reimplementation.",

This would be basic with loops but I was just bored so vectorized it.

Sure, youre on rMachineLearning and perhaps its a somewhat valid assumption that people will immediately get your acronyms. But did it every occur to you that others besides those who are deeply into machine learning might be reading posts and that they might not know? The issue here is communication. It takes effort, and it takes a certain strain of empathy, to put yourself into your audiences shoes and ask yourself if what you are writing  be it in a programming language or a natural language  is, in fact, easily understandable.

Put it up on Github they said. Im all for opensource, but when a company turns around and charges you for a product they made with freely and publicly made content, while forbidding you from using the output to create competing models, that is where I draw the line. It is simply ridiculous. Sam Altman couldnt be anymore predictable with his recent attempts to get the government to start regulating AI. What risks? The AI is just a messenger for information that is already out there if one knows howwhere to look. You dont need AI to learn how to hack, to learn how to make weapons, etc. Fake newspropaganda? The internet has all of that covered. LLMs are no where near the level of AI you see in scifi. I mean, are people really afraid of text? Yes, I know that text can sometimes be malicious code such as viruses, but those can be found on github as well. If they fall for this they might as well shutdown the internet while theyre at it. He is simply blowing things out of proportion and using fear to increase the likelihood that they do what he wants, hurt the competition. I bet he is probably teething with bitterness everytime a new huggingface model comes out. The thought of us peasants being able to use AI privately is too dangerous. No, instead we must be fed scraps while they slowly take away our jobs and determine our future. This is not a doomer post, as I am all in favor of the advancement of AI. However, the real danger here lies in having a company like OpenAI dictate the future of humanity. I get it, the writing is on the wall the cost of human intelligence will go down, but if everyone has their personal AI then it wouldnt seem so bad or unfair would it? Listen, something that has the power to render a college degree that costs thousands of dollars worthless should be available to the public. This is to offset the damages and job layoffs that will come as a result of such an entity. It wouldnt be as bitter of a taste as it would if you were replaced by it while still not being able to access it. Everyone should be able to use it as leverage, it is the only fair solution. If we dont take action now, a company like ClosedAI will, and they are not in favor of the common folk. Sam Altman is so calculated to the point where there were times when he seemed to be shooting OpenAI in the foot during his talk. This move is to simply conceal his real intentions, to climb the ladder and take it with him. If he didnt include his company in his ramblings, he would be easily read. So instead, he pretends to be scared of his own product, in an effort to legitimize his claim. Dont fall for it. They are slowly making a reputation as one the most hated tech companies, right up there with Adobe, and they dont show any sign of change. They have no moat, othewise they wouldnt feel so threatened to the point where they would have to resort to creating barriers of entry via regulation. This only means one thing, we are slowly catching up. We just need someone to vouch for humanitys wellbeing, while acting as an opposing force to the evil corporations who are only looking out for themselves. Question is, who would be a good candidate?",

He said he would donate 1bn if he could take over the nonprofit. OpenAI turned that down and Elon separated ways with Elon I think donating a final 100m. To clarify, Elon was never the only donor, nor was it confirmed he was the biggest donor. OpenAIs needed 500m1b in donations to continue as a nonprofit, but that was pretty hard how could you compete w Google wo a boat load of money, so they started a subsidiary that would generate returns for investors, but capping the profit. Essentially, after OpenAI returns on your investment at the agreed multiplier, then thats it for that investment. The rest of the profit is given to the nonprofit.  OpenAI LPs primary fiduciary obligation is to advance the aims of the OpenAI Charter, and the company is controlled by OpenAI Nonprofits board. All investors and employees sign agreements that OpenAI LPs obligation to the Charter always comes first, even at the expense of some or all of their financial stake.",

Temporal Defense Systems can be used to prevent catastrophic events from occurring, such as the assassination of key historical figures or the alteration of important events that could have major consequences for the timeline.

I think it likely happen alongside AGI development if AGI ever comes about. Alignment isnt some side thing, it is a fundamental part of the specification. If you have a misaligned AGI you have a broken model or bad specification. Right now we prevent misalignment by doing a good job creating our loss functions and designing good problem statements. Maybe in the future more of that will be abstracted away. The fact remains that if a model isnt aligned it is designed wrong. I dont think alignment is some new thing. The AGI should have either taken all objectives including the many objectives of what not to do that it was not explicitly told and so on into account or had the reasoning ability to generate them dynamically.",

This is a monumentally weird worldview. You assume that there is one and only one possible path of progress for humanity and that everyone naturally must share this exact vision. That borders on solipcism. And even if Altman does believe in a Drexlerian future as the one true priority he might take the view that ASI would trivialize the development of nanotechnology and focus on AGI as a path to this. After all, the defining feature of nanotech is that it is small, physical resources arent likely to be a fundamental bottleneck. With ASI providing the intellectual labor, why would the development of this technology be particularly expensive?

The disagreement about OpenAI isnt that they are making a profit, but rather that they are using their position to advance several goals that people believe are good for them, but bad for machine learning as a general field. I am aware that this post was not the best expression of these concerns, but it is definitely a concern for a lot of people involved in machine learning. If success in machine learning as a technology is tied to having the right organizational alliances, connections, and political clout, things get worse for actual machine learning research, and that definitely looks to be the direction OpenAI has taken for the last several years.",

        "description": "I recently encountered the PaLM Scaling Language Modeling with Pathways paper from Google Research and it opened up a can of worms of ideas Ive felt Ive intuitively had for a while, but have been unable to express  and I know I cant be the only one. Sometimes I wonder what the original pioneers of AI  Turing, Neumann, McCarthy, etc.  would think if they could see the state of AI that weve gotten ourselves into. 67 authors, 83 pages, 540B parameters in a model, the internals of which no one can say they comprehend with a straight face, 6144 TPUs in a commercial lab that no one has access to, on a rig that no one can afford, trained on a volume of data that a human couldnt process in a lifetime, 1 page on ethics with the same ideas that have been rehashed over and over elsewhere with no attempt at a solution  bias, racism, malicious use, etc.  for purposes that who asked for? When I started my career as an AIML research engineer 2016, I was most interested in two types of tasks  1. those that most humans could do but that would universally be considered tedious and nonscalable. Im talking image classification, sentiment analysis, even document summarization, etc. 2. tasks that humans lack the capacity to perform as well as computers for various reasons  forecasting, risk analysis, game playing, and so forth. I still love my career, and I try to only work on projects in these areas, but its getting harder and harder. This is because, somewhere along the way, it became popular and unquestionably acceptable to push AI into domains that were originally uniquely human, those areas that sit at the top of Maslowss hierarchy of needs in terms of selfactualization  art, music, writing, singing, programming, and so forth. These areas of endeavor have negative logarithmic ability curves  the vast majority of people cannot do them well at all, about 10 can do them decently, and 1 or less can do them extraordinarily. The little discussed problem with AIgeneration is that, without extreme deterrence, we will sacrifice human achievement at the top percentile in the name of lowering the bar for a larger volume of people, until the AI ability range is the norm. This is because relative to humans, AI is cheap, fast, and infinite, to the extent that investments in human achievement will be watered down at the societal, educational, and individual level with each passing year. And unlike AI gameplay which superseded humans decades ago, we wont be able to just disqualify the machines and continue to play as if they didnt exist. Almost everywhere I go, even this forum, I encounter almost universal deference given to current SOTA AI generation systems like GPT3, CODEX, DALLE, etc., with almost no one extending their implications to its logical conclusion, which is longterm convergence to the mean, to mediocrity, in the fields they claim to address or even enhance. If youre an artist or writer and youre using DALLE or GPT3 to enhance your work, or if youre a programmer saying, GitHub CoPilot makes me a better programmer?, then how could you possibly know? Youve disrupted and bypassed your own creative process, which is thoughts  optionally words  actions  feedback  repeat, and instead seeded your canvas with ideas from a machine, the provenance of which you cant understand, nor can the machine reliably explain. And the more you do this, the more you make your creative processes dependent on said machine, until you must question whether or not you could work at the same level without it. When I was a college student, I often dabbled with weed, LSD, and mushrooms, and for a while, I thought the ideas I was having while under the influence were revolutionary and groundbreaking  that is until took it upon myself to actually start writing down those ideas and then reviewing them while sober, when I realized they werent that special at all. What I eventually determined is that, under the influence, it was impossible for me to accurately evaluate the druginduced ideas I was having because the influencing agent the generates the ideas themselves was disrupting the same frame of reference that is responsible evaluating said ideas. This is the same principle of  if you took a pill and it made you stupider, would even know it? I believe that, especially over the longterm timeframe that crosses generations, theres significant risk that current AIgeneration developments produces a similar effect on humanity, and we mostly wont even realize it has happened, much like a frog in boiling water. If you have children like I do, how can you be aware of the the current SOTA in these areas, project that 20 to 30 years, and then and tell them with a straight face that it is worth them pursuing their talent in art, writing, or music? How can you be honest and still say that widespread implementation of autocorrection hasnt made you and others worse and worse at spelling over the years a task that even I believe most would agree is tedious and worth automating. Furthermore, Ive yet to set anyone discuss the train  generate  train  generate feedback loop that longterm application of AIgeneration systems imply. The first generations of these models were trained on wide swaths of web data generated by humans, but if these systems are permitted to continually spit out content without restriction or verification, especially to the extent that it reduces or eliminates development and investment in human talent over the long term, then what happens to the 4th or 5th generation of models? Eventually we encounter this situation where the AI is being trained almost exclusively on AIgenerated content, and therefore with each generation, it settles more and more into the mean and mediocrity with no way out using current methods. By the time that happens, what will we have lost in terms of the creative capacity of people, and will we be able to get it back? By relentlessly pursuing this direction so enthusiastically, Im convinced that we as AIML developers, companies, and nations are past the point of no return, and it mostly comes down the investments in time and money that weve made, as well as a prisoners dilemma with our competitors. As a society though, this direction weve chosen for shortterm gains will almost certainly make humanity worse off, mostly for those who are powerless to do anything about it  our children, our grandchildren, and generations to come. If youre an AI researcher or a data scientist like myself, how do you turn things back for yourself when youve spent years on years building your career in this direction? Youre likely making near or north of 200k annually TC and have a family to support, and so its too late, no matter how you feel about the direction the field has gone. If youre a company, how do you standby and let your competitors aggressively push their AutoML solutions into more and more markets without putting out your own? Moreover, if youre a manager or thought leader in this field like Jeff Dean how do you justify to your own boss and your shareholders your teams billions of dollars in AI investment while simultaneously balancing ethical concerns? You cant  the only answer is bigger and bigger models, more and more applications, more and more data, and more and more automation, and then automating that even further. If youre a country like the US, how do responsibly develop AI while your competitors like China singlemindedly push full steam ahead without an iota of ethical concern to replace you in numerous areas in global power dynamics? Once again, failing to compete would be preemptively admitting defeat. Even assuming that none of what Ive described here happens to such an extent, how are so few people not taking this seriously and discounting this possibility? If everything Im saying is fearmongering and nonsense, then Id be interested in hearing what you think humanAI coexistence looks like in 20 to 30 years and why it isnt as demoralizing as Ive made it out to be. x200B EDIT Day after posting this  this post took off way more than I expected. Even if I received 20  25 comments, I would have considered that a success, but this went much further. Thank you to each one of you that has read this post, even more so if you left a comment, and triply so for those who gave awards! Ive read almost every comment that has come in even the troll ones, and am truly grateful for each one, including those in sharp disagreement. Ive learned much more from this discussion with the sub than I could have imagined on this topic, from so many perspectives. While I will try to reply as many comments as I can, the sheer comment volume combined with limited free time between work and family unfortunately means that there are many that I likely wont be able to get to. That will invariably include some that I would love respond to under the assumption of infinite time, but I will do my best, even if the latency stretches into days. Thank you all once again!",

Except we have a massive volume of preML recordings of the past. Movies, podcasts, political debates, art, music, etc. If people are truly getting more stupid, someone will write about it in a really epic book or blogpost and people will get excited at the idea of the higher oldschool intelligence. It doesnt take much to rally humans around an idea, just a strong statement, some arguments, and a bit of emotions. If you have children like I do, how can you be aware of the the current SOTA in these areas, project that 20 to 30 years, and then and tell them with a straight face that it is worth them pursuing their talent in art, writing, or music? Moreso than ever. Artists will be more empowered than ever. Not everyone is making AI art by feeding a beautiful landscape with elephants, by bob ross into DALLE 2, some people are feeding fullblown paragraphs that are the work of their own genius. The mediocrity you see is simply a result of the 90 mediocre masses now having access to image synthesis. There is still a 10 making things you have never seen before anywhere in history. We can blend any material, art style, time period, in ways which are traditionally impossible. How can you be honest and still say that widespread implementation of autocorrection hasnt made you and others worse and worse at spelling over the years Actually it made me and a lot of other people far better writers. The same way, writing with GPT3 will increase your vocabulary and eloquence. When I was a college student, I often dabbled with weed, LSD, and mushrooms, and for a while, I thought the ideas I was having while under the influence were revolutionary and groundbreaking  that is until took it upon myself to actually start writing down those ideas and then reviewing them while sober, when I realized they werent that special at all. If I take mushrooms and hear a full art rock piece in my mind, and record myself humming it, is it fair to say that piece of music wasnt very impressive? How do you know the writing properly encapsulates the genius within the 1015 parameters in your brain at that time? The fact that you are raising these questions is proof that human intelligence will never go down. We have infinitely many more parameters than even the biggest ML models out there. 540B is baby numbers compared to the human brain which has a whopping 1015. Thats why I laugh at all this fearmongering about using ML to make highly optimized ads that can manipulate you. You are gravely underestimating what a 1015 parameter model can do. It can only animate some physical limbs, but that shit runs deep up there. We dont need to worry about a single thing, let everything happen and fix itself. Keep in mind these DL milestones trickle down to civilians. We may not be able to run pathways, but we can run EPIC smeardefamation campaigns on higherups at google. People in power are gonna have to watch out way more than ever before, the common people is gaining on a scary level of power. All it takes is for people to organize around an idea to rally up all that insane multimodal power.",

That may be naivety as I am still very early in my learning and career, but Ill try to set out the differences as I perceive them It is true that any overtuned AI system will cater to the dataset meanby design. It is also true that were seeing more synthetic or generative data used to fill the gaps in humanlabeled or humansourced datasets. It is even more true that the last few years have seen a triumphant eruption of AIdriven art writing, music, and images at the forefront and their uses for collaboration with humans or even some that would use the collaborative ability to nearly supplant the human in the process. I do think there are real risks in continued dataset creationeven today. When we train models to mimic humans and unleash them upon the internet without explicit label maliciously or not, they impact real human expression. Shortform online writing like TwitterRedditAmazon reviews, traditional sources for ML datasets, are infected with these unlabeled actors and it WILL affect anyone who tries to build a new dataset under the assumption that most data is human in origin. The entire concept of GANs are a real problem here as a tool to refine any filter into a better model and any model into a better filter, perhaps leaving real human output as poorly performing AI at some point I think a lot of my optimism comes from a belief that a large core of human art comes from selfexpression and external authenticity. We have had PNGs of the Mona Lisa for decades now, but people still visit the Louvre to see the original not because they cant get a print that large, or light it well, but because there is a human connection in the authenticity of the original work. A large amount of artists operate in a relative degree of unknownness. Their art is increasingly motivated by their own expression rather than recognition for quality, fame, or skill, though many of them will possess these qualities perhaps even in sufficient amounts. Improved collaboration with AI and solo AI work will certainly change what the baseline for becoming famous is, but art is a fickle beast that adversarially deviates from any mean via subversion, so our current techniques are not wellsuited to remain ahead of the game. Finally, in terms of valuation, I do believe AI pose a potentially existential threat to smalltime artists IF and perhaps only if society fails to acknowledge the authenticity of pure human or mostly human art with money. A lot of current money flows into these economies from advertising, which doesnt care about art sources unless people do. But advertising doesnt want to advertise to bots who wont spend money and why would bots start accumulating wealth and spending it so there should be some economic incentive to keep things from going too far.

Chess and poker are activities in which the main interest for consumers is the process. Most people arent interested in only seeing the final position in a chess match or the final hands in poker. They tune in for the drama of the unfolding events. In most of the creative pursuits mentioned by OP, such as art, music, writing, and programming, the point of interest is usually the end product. Sure there is some relatively limited interest in watching the process as well, but I think OP makes a fair point in that AI is potentially putting creative human output in those fields in jeopardy. Put in other words, youre more likely to buy a beautiful piece of art generated by AI than you are to buy, or tune into, a sequence of chess moves generated by AI. I think you make a good point in that performanceexhibition might become the main draw of those arts, but Im not convinced. Sure theme park caricature drawers and future Bob Rosses can probably expect job security through the next many decades, but will people tune in to watch a great artist create something over many many hours that AI can do better in a second? And if some do, is it enough to maintain a culture and industry?

Progressive Rock and Speed Metal are sort of the last genres for virtuosos. Punk embraced the crisis, electronica went beyond it. Moving from the orchestra to the DJ passing through the rock band we are not just witnessing the passage of time but a trend of automation reshaping the subject of musical artistry. New artistic roles emerged through the automation.

Why are you assuming it will continue towards a regression towards the mean? When Copilot suggests completions that have been further trained on the entirety of my own codebase from years of work at my own level of competency, often the suggestions it makes that are the most successful are the ones that push me towards consistency with what I have already written. Humans have a seven plus or minus two problem that AI does not. You are equating broad models that have not been further specialized towards excellence as what will continue to be the status quo moving forward. But thats not realistically going to be the marketable models. How many prompts for DALLE 2 are asking for a mediocre photo, vs the huge amount of prompt engineering weve now seen throwing in lens terms and award winning to bias results towards mimicing professional quality? Dont you think a model that, rather than enshrining mediocrity, preempted a bias towards excellence would be more successful in the market than a broad model that could create mediocre results? Were still in the very early stages of these models, and you are making the critical mistake of extrapolating scale forward in time without extrapolating quality forward as well. Right now, were just throwing all the data we can into them. But then human interactions with the models will generate more data on qualitative assessments of the output and will allow for biasing towards excellence over mediocrity. As an example, I recently caught a user who was using GPT3 to answer niche questions in an academic subreddit, and it was doing a terrible job. But I know full well that if they had pretrained using the comment history of the top comments on the top posts each day for the past few years, that the model would have been much more compelling and harder to spot. The scientists developing the models are going to be making different design decisions regarding qualitative bias from the boards bringing them to market. TLDR Models that regress to the mean arent going to be around much longer, as the next stage in the commercialization of AI models is going to be introducing intentional biases towards excellence.",

Theres always someone who wants a product that has a higher status value than what everyone else has, but for the majority of people, if they cant experience the difference between two products Im not sure theyd care. I also dont think people necessarily crave novel art as much as novel experiences  for ex, nostalgia is one of our most powerful emotions and its rooted in the old having become so unfamiliar it feels enjoyable to discover again. AI art might be derivative over time but it doesnt have to be novel to get the everyday consumer on board.

Foundational models and hyperlarge models happen to be a great way to do that  nobody else can pull it off, and it gives them monopoly, regardless if that is the best way to advance the field. The second way you see MLAI applied in the industry is for tasks that ultimately are more harmful than good  think algorithmic management, increased surveillance and amazon workers pissing in bottles. Or stuff that collects data on you that can then be sold to someone. The third way, is that of Potemkin AI as Jathan Sadowski of the This Machine Kills podcast puts  stuff like Uber and Tesla hype for selfdriving cars and so on  using the _promise_ of AI as a way to speculate and raise money from gullible VCs which in my book is really all VCs, how did we end up in a society where important stuff like new technology development is in the hands of unaccountable, unelected individuals . And the final way  the little players, the vast majority of companies out there that want to have an ML department, or to say they are AIdriven or whatever ... usually have no idea whether they actually need the technology at all. And the decision makers in these companies are very often very poorly equipped with the knowledge to identify what and where you can use ML. Add in to that, that because of its probabilistic nature and fragility it is very difficult to integrate it with the rest of the company, even if it will be undoubtfully beneficial.  how do responsibly develop AI You kind of do not not. The thing about we caring about ethics and China not is bs. We just obfuscate it behind a layer of corporate speech and PR and offload it to private entities with a lot less supervision from the government and a lot more potential for ... less than ethical outcomes. Your only option for it to be truly ethical is to find one of the companies that dont know what to do with ML ... which quickly becomes soul crushing.  So we have ended up in a situation where our research direction as a society is more or less locked for the foreseeable future in the direction of the foundational models, and where AI is used for speculation, to fuck workers over, to increase surveillance ... or for no purpose whatever. And people do not care for very simple reasons  these arent really topics that people into tech discuss, and techoptimism is pretty much prevalent everywhere, and few people dare discuss, or are even aware of some of the very very ideological sides of the predominant spirit of tech and techoptimism. I think, barring a global revolution, in the next 2030 years the future is rather grim  at worse climate change will make it rather untenable to use big models, and the decline of capitalism will lead us to a very dystopic future that will make the roaring 20s and your favorite cyberpunk stories sound absolutely lovely ... shits fucked yo. p.s. Also while people tend to mention Turing and Von Neuman and the like, I find that Norbert Wiener is a lot more interesting person to look at here  especially with his The Human Use of Human Beings",

If you have children like I do, how can you be aware of the the current SOTA in these areas, project that 20 to 30 years, and then and tell them with a straight face that it is worth them pursuing their talent in art, writing, or music? I believe or my hope is that the value of something that was made by humans will remain. Right now DALLE is something unique, few have access to it even fewer use seriously. It is almost a big selling point aka look at what our AI can do that a human can, in the future where it becomes more common maybe the impressive human things will become even more unique, maybe it will be less perfect, but at least in the artistic applications that OP is referring to there is some way, we all go shop cheap tables from IKEA but those custom handmade ones? they are desired, even though the build quality and price are different. The uncanny valley still exists after all we have good autopilots, control systems, but we still trust people to stick the landing. The point at which the society will see machines as something different than a tool is still far away and just as unlikely. It can be like Detroit Become Human or it can also be like Dune. Discussions on what happens after AI takes off are fun but maybe have not much purpose as at that moment what we are will change. x200B EDIT I do think this post raises some valid concerns about the direction of the industry, its push for maximum optimization without thinking about the consequences too hard.",

The big corps like it because its applied they use these models in business. But far more impactful as well as less resource intensive is to work on the fundamentals. Work on the math only needs a laptop, or pencil and paper. Figuring out why certain techniques work or finding new techniques from first principles, is worth a lot more in the long run that adding .02 accuracy on some test data set. If you still want to be applied, look at constrained models. How well can you do when the training has to be online or at least periodically updated, has to do inference in real time, and the hardware you got is on the level of a Raspberry Pi?",

This level of speed and efficiency can improve the creative process but doesnt inherently inhibit it. People will still find novelty in human talent and skill even if a machine can do it better.

My guess is that this is a depiction of hidden layers inside of an image processing neural network. Could be for classification or generation, cant really tell. What happens is that each layer in the net goes through multiple filters  those are probably the rectangles moving around the outside of the object in the animation. You can think of the filters as doing some transformation on the pixel values in an image. For example, average these 9 pixel values together. That transformation is displayed in the animation as the dots changing colors and directions. Then, after the filter and transformations are applied, the results are passed through a logic gate to see if they activate or not. Thats visualized as the dots popping into and out of existence. Each layer in the neural net will have lots of different filterstransformationsactivations going on in parallel. The results of all of that are then passed on to the next layer of the network.

Come to think about it, everything is just atoms doing atomy things, so why dont we depict humans as atoms? Whats with these misleading organs and limbs in biology books? Oh, thats because computers are just atoms too and that will make computers equal to humans and no one wants that. I see.

It appears that Siraj recently offered a course Make Money with Machine Learning with a registration fee but did not follow through with promises made in the initial offering of the course. On top of that, he created a refund and warranty page with information regarding the course after people already paid. Here is a link to a WayBackMachine captures of uklarkens documentation of Sirajs potential misdeeds case for a refund discussion in course Discord 1200 individuals in the course Multiple Slack channel discussion, students hidden from each other Hundreds refunded According to Twitter threads, he has been banning anyone in his DiscordSlack that has been asking for refunds. On top of this there are many Twitter threads regarding his behavior. A screenshot bottom of post of an account that has since been deactivateddeleted he made the account to try and get Sirajs attention. Here is a Twitter WayBackMachine archive link of a search for the user in the screenshot  In the search results it is apparent that there are many students who have been impacted by Siraj. UPDATE 1 Additional searching on Twitter has yielded many more posts, check out the tweetsretweets of these people student1 student2 UPDATE 2 A user mentioned that I should ask a question on rlegaladvice regarding the legality of the refusal to refund and whatnot. I have done so here It appears that per California commerce law where the School of AI is registered individuals have the right to ask for a refund for 30 days. UPDATE 3 Siraj has replied to the post below, and on Twitter Way Back Machine capture UPDATE 4 Another student has shared their interactions via this Imgur post And another recorded moderators actively suppressing any mentions of refunds on a live stream Here is an example of assignment quality, note that the assignment is to generate fashion designs not pneumonia prediction. UPDATE5 Relevant Reddit posts Siraj response question about opinions on course two weeks before this SirajUdacity relationship UPDATE6 The Register has published a piece on the debacle Coffezilla posted a video on all of this UPDATE7 Example of blatant ripoff GitHub user gregwchase diabetic retinopathy Sirajs ripoff UPDATE8 Siraj has a new paper and it is plagiarized If you wereare a student in the course and have your own documentation of your interactions, please feel free to bring them to my attention either via DM or in the comments below and I will add them to the main body here. x200B",

This gets worse when the same hype seeps into the industry in such a way that people started getting jobs with relatively limited backgrounds early on. Making a whole lot of people think it really is that easy and lucrative a field to get into. A brand is enough to trigger that mentality anywhere for anyone.

Some of the links above complain that people who ask for a refund get banned from slack, and that the networking part will happen only at the end of the course. I dont see the problem, either you get the refund or the benefit of the course. Personally Im happy with the course. I have some programming experience but otherwise had no experience with ML. I think its a good introduction and a good value. Ive paid more for just the manuals of university courses. Im impressed how easy it was to get started with ML libraries in general. I saw the comments from some ML experts in the comments here. While its true I dont expect to be able to compete on the same job applications with them at the end of the course, I think ML is becoming a lot more accessible to programmers and nonprogrammers. After completing the first homework I was able to make a webpage able to recognize tumbsup and thumbsdown from my webcam feed. Theres other content out there but this is the one that actually got me started. For me thats already worthit.",

You might need to brush up on your math background to get through the Bengio book, but you really get something out of it. People should take a year or two to approach it. But its better than youutube tutorials, I dont think they really teach anything.",

Im curious how reflective of political leaning a users number of comments per subreddit compares to other distribution data available. It might also be interesting to add a Dropout layer in your network, since many subreddits could be noisy  have little to do with political leaning. This is a really cool, fast result, and your training code looks clean. Have you considered processing the texts of the posts themselves? Its a significantly more difficult task, but it could be revealing to see how much correlation between number of comments like youre using here vs. actual text in predicting political leaning.",

The features used here are not the comments text however, but the number of comments made, grouped by subreddit. So you can think of each weight used in the calculation as associated with a particular subreddit. For example rconservative may have a weight of 1.2 and rpolitics a weight of 0.3 Had I made 5 comments in rconservative and 10 in rpolitics I would be predicted a value of 3 which would correspond to likely being right wing. In a sense we can codify the leaning of a subreddit by looking at its value in the weight vector.",

                "comentario": "This is such a simple yet amazingly awesome idea. Great work! Id be curious to know the distribution of flairs in PCM. Is it fairly rightleft balanced, or skewed towards one side of the spectrum? Edit The leftright distributions both of the available flairs themselves like, are there equal numbers of liberal and conservative flairs to choose from and of how PCM subredditors actually use them like, is the PCM community mostly liberal, mostly conservative, or evenly split. Also, Im curious how many different flairs there are to choose from in PCM, and to know the reliability metrics for each. In other words, given two users who each use the e.g., authright flair, do both users interpret authright to mean the same thing and accordingly agree with each others views, or are the flairs completely subjective such that two selfdescribed authright users may actually belong to different political subgroups? WRT the reliability issue, I feel like it would be difficult in practice to actually measure this for these flairs youd need some independent and trustworthy metric of political leaning and perhaps run a chi square test using that as your baseline. However, even without such an analysis, if there are tons of flairs to choose from, I think you could claim a priori that their reliability as signalers of political leaning will be fairly low, compared to if there were just 34 flairs that were all unequivocally different and mutually exclusive. The reason Im waxing about reliability here is that your whole design  using the flairs as the ground truth  is premised on the flairs being clear, consistent signalers of political affiliation, but if they are used unreliably and thus very noisy, they wouldnt be a good proxy for use in classification. I hope thats not the case, because your idea is too cool!",

For most subreddits the amount of comments made is 0, and so a DictVectorizer transformer is used to produce a sparse array from json data. The target features used in training are userflairs found in rpoliticalcompassmemes. For example authright or libleft.

If the distributions are similar, I think you can safely conclude that the PCM flairs are reliable indicators. Im not a statistician, but IMHO it would be worth doing that before you include this project in your portfolio.",

This was done a while ago, but the distribution has not changed much since. As for the user flairs, they are completely subjective and as such the results should be interpreted as which group of PCM users do I most align with. Its a very good point that the whole design is premised on the ground truth of the flairs being clear indicatiors of political affiliation and there may be significant sampling bias considering it was only trained on PCM users.",
