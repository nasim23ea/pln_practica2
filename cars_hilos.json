        "description": "My garage raccoon likes to use my rack of winter tires as a fort. He's usually really good about keeping it clean so I don't check it very often, but today I noticed he was peeing inside of one of the Hankooks. Is there anything in pee that could harm the inside of a tire? Edit: It's over a month later and I'm still getting replies and questions! For everyone who keeps asking, you can follow more garage raccoon hijinks on my [instagram](http://instagram.com/bradgillette) and [YouTube](http://youtube.com/bradgillette).",

I don't want to use poison as I wouldn't want to hurt the animals I'm cool with. Current plan is to re-do the garage door seals with heavy duty stuff and use traps when the raccoons aren't in the garage. I finally gave up and started using old fashioned traps inside the house and they took care of the problem within a week.",

From Wikipedia: >In many languages, the raccoon is named for its characteristic dousing behavior in conjunction with that language's term for bear, for example Waschbär in German, orsetto lavatore in Italian, mosómedve in Hungarian and araiguma (アライグマ) in Japanese. In French and European Portuguese, the washing behavior is combined with these languages' term for rat, yielding, respectively, raton laveur and ratão-lavadeiro. The raccoon's scientific name, Procyon lotor, is neo-Latin, meaning \"before-dog washer\", with lotor Latin for \"washer\" and Procyon Latinized Greek from προ-, \"before\" and κύων, \"dog\".\"",

Rabies and distemper are wildly misunderstood by the common public. To start with, the symptoms of both would include the raccoons acting drunk, wobbly, and sickly. They would have trouble eating or drinking. That foaming at the mouth is true...but it doesnt mean the raccoon is vicious. It means, sadly, that the poor thing can no longer swallow. OP if you are reading this, congrats for being a lovable person to coons. If you ever see one with runny eyes, saliva foaming, or acting drunk, please try to keep it separate from the rest. Distemper and rabies is contagious through shared meals or shared water bowls. The good news is though, it is highly unlikely your raccoons will come into contact with any of these viruses. Even in the wild (woods, forest) it is a very small percentage who do.",

I'm just sitting in here with the car off where I got gas because I don't know what I should do. Advice? Update: I'm not just a dumbass I'm a double fucking dumbass...I didn't put diesel in my car it was just regular gas. I jist panicked because I saw a big sign in front of the gas station that said DIESEL and a price per gallon. The diesel is there just not where I fueld up. I guess my excuse is that I'm seventeen and relatively new to driving my own car as of a couple months ago...but still. Things like this lead me to believe I won't make it far in life Second edit: To the people replying that the diesel nozzle wouldn't even fit, that's what I meant. I didn't know what a diesel nozzle looked like and thought the gas nozzle I had was the diesel nozzle, and freaked out **EDIT**: Someone found me out in real life fuck me. He's probably reading this and its blowing his mind right now. Btw my hentai stash is under ur bed",

Left the service station and got about a kilometer up the road when the car started to run roughly and lose power. So much so that it would only move at just above idle. As soon as we tried to accelerate it would die. We decided to go back and get another car. About a kilometer past the service station we noticed a car on the side of the road with the bonnet up and remembered that he was filling up the same time we were. We stopped and sure enough he had the same problem. He had filled his tank and the car wouldn't run at all, we had just topped up so we knew it must be a fuel problem. So he and his passenger jumped in our car and we headed back to the servo. The kid working there had no idea what to do when confronted by two lots of pissed off customers. We got him to turn on the pump and found it was diesel instead of regular petrol. He said that the tanker had just been there before we had both filled up and must have filled the wrong tank. He rang the owner but got no response so he was all out of ideas. By this stage it was about two in the morning and we didn't want to hang around any longer. We found a drum and were able to drain our tank and refill with super. We demanded our money back as well for our trouble. Went on our way without further problem. No idea what happened with the other customer but he wasn't happy. This was a car with a carburetor, no idea how an injection system would cope but don't see any reason it would react differently.",

This leads to massive engine damage. Gasoline also isn't as good of a lubricant as diesel (feel some diesel, its oily).

So there I was middle of nowhere, station was closed. It was like 15 degrees outside, putting fuel in my diesel. Suddenly it occurred to me that the pump was pumping awful quick for it being 15 degree... Oh shit this is gas. So now there is a bunch of gas in my diesel tank, and the tank has no drain plug, thanks EPA, and the wife is getting cold, but I can't start the car. Things are bleak. Along comes Kentucky Jesus, my fucking savior. \"Hey buddy, do you have a gas can and a hose for some free gasoline?\" \"Heck yeah\" \"Ok man, here's what we need to do, there is a tank of diesel with gas floating on top, (thanks physics) and we need to syphon off the gasoline.\" \"Sounds good\" So then I syphoned until the hose felt warm, because the diesel is going to be warmer because it's an oil, and has been in a heated tank. I then thanked Kentucky Jesus, gave him $50 to buy a turkey for Thanksgiving, and the free gas, and went on my way all the way to New York. Not a single issue with the car after that.

What I ended up doing was filling my tank up with premium, and then topping up with more premium every 100 kilometers or so. My car was still running 600 kilometers later, at that point I ran the car until it was nearly empty and pretended I hadn't put diesel in my car in the first place.

Only diesels you'll generally see here are VWs, old Mercedes, and old Volvos. VW is pretty much the only company that still widely sells new diesel passenger cars in the USA, and their recent cheating on environmental testing hasn't exactly helped the public opinion. It has a lot to do with diesel being put in a certain regulatory niche I think,where most manufacturers don't bother with them. Kind of like how it's disproportionately profitable for them to sell consumer size pickup trucks because of exemption from some certain rules. I probably see (or hear and smell) diesel VWs in my city a few times per week... in any case most people just think of diesel as being something for trucks.",

My shop had recently rebuilt the engine in his 1970's-vintage european sports sedan equipped with mechanical fuel injection. We were specialists in the marque concerned and while everything about the rebuild and installation was completely proper and sanitary, this customer would invent little problems on a daily basis. We had privately concluded that he was a little bit 'off' in the head, but did our best to humor him and trouble-shoot the litany of non-existent issues which he kept returning with. One day the customer (we'll just call him \"Jim\") phones us up mad as hell, and says the car has lost power and will barely run, and that he is on his way down to the shop. He piled several minutes of profanity and verbal abuse onto us complaining of our allegedly substandard work and general incompetence, but nonetheless we cleared a bay for him. We had a strong policy of standing behind our work - if there was a problem and we were responsible for it, we were going to take care of it regardless of cost (and despite the lunacy of the client.) Jim arrives at the shop, and the car is just belching black smoke from every orifice, popping, banging, misfiring and barely running. We wave him directly into the empty bay and note a heavy chemical stench about the car as it passes through the door. We immediately set to work inspecting it, looking first at the fuel and ignition systems. Spark and ignition checked out fine. The mechanical fuel injection system on this particular car employed translucent plastic fuel lines from the injection pump to the injectors, and we noted that the color of the fuel was abnormally dark. Combined with the general symptoms and stench permeating the car, it was pretty obvious that the car had been filled with diesel. We questioned Jim about when the symptoms had started, and he had indeed just filled the car up prior to the problem starting. He swore up and down though that he had not incorrectly filled the tank and was adamant that the engine had failed. We told him to leave the car and that we'd inspect it further, reiterating that if there was an engine problem we would fix it. About an hour later I happened to note a paper receipt sitting on the passenger seat. It was from the gas station that same day, and showed a fill up from diesel pump #7. I quickly made a photocopy of the receipt, and put the original back in the car. We pumped the fuel tank dry, flushed it several times with plain gas, flushed the electric pump and lines, and ran a half tank of fuel through the engine to flush out the injection pump and injectors, after which the car ran fine. We called Jim and told him to come and get it. It was my pleasure to instruct Jim that he had indeed filled the car with diesel, that the receipt proving it was laying on the seat, that he had voided his engine warranty, and where would he like the several jerry cans of waste diesel to be put?",

Also, my daughter who lives 6 hours away is about to give birth any day and wants us to drop everything and drive there when she goes into labor, to watch her preschooler while she's in the hospital. If I start the tomatoes and we get the call before they're done, in theory I could move the dehydrator to the truck and run it on an inverter while we drive. Would hotboxing the concentrated tomato fumes kill us or the parrot who has to ride with us? Would the smell stay in his nice truck forever, in the upholstery and the air system, leaving me with beautiful dried tomatoes but a failed marriage? There's no way to run it in the bed of the truck, it would have to be inside where the people and birds sit. **UPDATE:** Still no sign of the baby coming, but since I originally posted this, the tomatoes started - and [finished](https://i.imgur.com/ATPz46E.jpg?1) dehydrating. So crisis averted, but I appreciate all the wisdom! I've learned some important things about my inverter, how to not crush an electrical cord, car detailing, and other things I won't list because they're too good to post spoilers here. **UPDATE 2** I forgot the first rule of baby making: You can't use a solar dehydrator when a woman goes into labor because it will always happen in the middle of the night. So good thing that wasn't necessary in the end. We got the call at 1am Saturday night and did the all night drive: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ENb6Gpt.jpg?1). Bonus - this went down during the Epic Night Of Snacks: https://slickdeals.net/f/14894878-24-count-1-5-oz-stacy-s-pita-chips-variety-pack-0-85-w-subscribe-save?src=SiteSearchV2_SearchBarV2Algo1 so as my husband was driving I was in the back seat ordering ridiculous amounts of snacks for pennies. Baby was born Sunday morning, here we are on Wednesday, haven't seen her yet because with covid only the mom and one visitor (her husband, obviously) could be in the hospital.

Trucks are just so practical that there's always something to love. Like a man who cooks. Being a flock mate to the parrot, imo not so much. Depending on what your husband thinks of the parrot, you might just find yourself renewing your vows if the parrot gets poisoned by tomato fumes. Your final resort might be too say, can I dehydrate these tomatoes in your truck. I won't complain a single bit if it kills the parrot. Like canaries in a coal mine, parrots are extraordinarily sensitive to air contamination, so it's not outside the realm of possibility that the parrot keels over.

If there's a car going 20 when the speed limit is 55, not only is it unreasonable to ask someone to take over twice as long to get where they're going, but you're going to run into congestion problems if you don't allow people to pass. If you're on a highway with five lanes going in one direction, you literally have 4 other lanes you can use to go around without having to write in exceptions. More reasonably, you have 1-2 options for going around the slowpoke. I don't know any state that has a traffic law explicitly permitting you to change lanes if the car ahead of you is moving slowly. Of course you can do that. If, to do so, you have to do something that is otherwise explicitly illegal, like crossing double yellow lines, that's when you need a law. Two different scenarios. Besides, we're talking about going slow in the fast/no-passing lane. I don't know how the notion of a passing lane is intelligible at all on a one-lane road.",

He got in a serious t-bone accident because of it (technically not his fault on paper, since it was a green he went through, other car blew a red, but could've been avoided if he hadn't been speeding). He flipped his car a few times and ended up sideways on the side of the road. Walked out with a couple bruises, thankfully, but since then he has never gone 1mph over the limit anywhere. It scared the crap out of him, now he'll go the speed limit if he's feeling like living a little, but he's regularly 5 under the limit at last, and is perfectly fine not passing a semi doing 63mph on the highway.",

If you live in a place where you have to scrape ice off your windshield, you probably know the pain of having to take your gloves off to control the climate controls. I don't give a fuck if my center stack is a car designers wet dream, I just want to be able to control my vehicle in the best possible way. Buttons and dials worked. I shouldn't have to go into a sub menu and tap a screen a bunch to control the air in the climate vents. Less used buttons like speaker adjustments can be controlled a submenu, but don't put climate controls in the touch screen. Edit: Grammar. Also in response to a few things. I know touch screen compatible gloves exist, but they don't work as well as your bare hand. And if the glove isn't perfectly fit or is a little loose, it will not work as well. The touch screen compatible gloves make navigating the menus cumbersome because they are gloves and it makes hitting the small buttons difficult. Also volume and channel should also have their own dials as well. The touch screens are a hazard. Anything that requires more driver attention to use is inherently more dangerous- and touch screens take more driver attention. They also add steps to making something function, that should be discouraged. Car reviewers should start trying to operate these vehicles with gloves on. Too much emphasis is placed on the appearance of the cabin, but that encourages this behavior of removing buttons and dials. I hope to see more emphasis being placed on every day functionality.",

There are simply more features than there is room for individual switches. Also, a panel that looks like a 747 would be really hard to use.",

According to a google search, the final drive ratio of the Tesla Model S is 9.73. It has a top speed of 155mph. I'm not sure of the limitations of RPM for electric drivetrains, so I assume for the case of the Roadster the gear ratio will be lowered to be able to reach the 250+mph without blowing up the motors. Assuming a similar 'top speed/gear ratio' ratio, 250 divided by 155, let's just round to 1.6. So let's now divide the current gear ratio to get a new gear ratio for the Roadster: 9.73/1.6=6.08. 6.08 final drive. Now let's try to find the drivetrain torque using the listed wheel torque and the final drive: 10,000/6.08=1,645Nm. That looks like a much more accurate number to compare to in my eyes. These are just my brain's thought processes with limited knowledge, so if my logic is off feel free to correct. Also, most of the sources I found list the P100D Ludicrous rated at ~930Nm, so I don't know where you got the 1250 number. At 930Nm, the wheel torque would be around 9,049",

Even on the P100D they have to use an alloy called inconel on the battery interconnects and fuses that the regular batteries don't use. This has even more power, so it's likely pretty costly to build all the power interconnects and whatnot. You also have to consider that they have to build a separate battery pack line just for this car, and setting that up costs money and since it's a lower volume vehicle the battery pack cost will be much higher since you have to divide the cost of setting up the line over the number of packs made. But you're definitely right in that the cost of the pack is likely not the cost of most of the car. The margins are probably not as high as people think though, setting up a special battery line to cram 200kwh batteries into a sports car that's likely going to be using a ton of carbon fiber and whatnot to keep the weight down is not gonna be cheap.",

The new Kia Telluride and Hyundai Palisade are selling like hot cakes and elevating the brand images significantly for both Hyundai and Kia. The new X7 is the new flagship from BMW and it's selling 3x the number of 7 series. Then we have examples like the Escalade and Navigator which are the halo cars for Cadillac and Lincoln. So here is the *really controversial* statement: An amazing move would be make the next GT-R a crossover, like the Lamborghini Urus. Before you tell me how awful that would be I'd like to mention the Urus now makes up for 60% of Lamborghini sales, and most non /r/cars people think SUVs are cool. A high performance SUV with the GT-R badge that competes against the Urus and Cayenne Turbo S for about $100k would both make business sense *and* achieves the marketing halo car effect. Otherwise a refreshed GT-R will be great on the Nurburgring, but its own sales will not be able to justify the increasingly expensive development cost for sports cars, despite the halo effect.",

They can keep the existing platforms & engines. They just need refreshed interiors/exteriors, in the way that Toyota did with the '07-'17 Camry- it was the same car underneath the whole time. Update the infotainment as well (the Maxima's is really good) and get JATCO to ditch the CVTs for regular planetary autos. As a bonus, get onboard the realistic electrification train (aka hybrids). This won't set the world on fire but it will stop the bleeding and address the real needs of paying customers, which is ultimately all that matters for Nissan's survival.",

Cause when I test drove one I got like 50km beyond advertised range before I started charging, and at that point it still ran, I wasn't at 0% or in some type of safety mode etc. And when looking at the claimed range of the Taycan with the hardware they install, there isn't really a reason why their range would be so much lower than Tesla, except that Porsche underestimates and Tesla tends to go right up to the upper limit. Its a bit like a Porsche PDK being a rock solid gearbox. They do not give a fuck how many times you launch the car, it will just work, because thats whats claimed. Overall I'd say that no traditional car manufacturer overpromises on the metrics that people are most interested in. Sports cars always produce as much or more power than claimed(Audi, McLaren, Porsche come to mind), fuel saving cars can be driven with lower consumption than expected (VW groups cheating Diesels, Honda Insight etc) And ever since Ford got sued for the Cobra fiasko they have been especially conservative on claimed numbers.",

Also, the enthusiast community has a decently long track record of shitting on anything that could be environmentally friendly. If car enthusiasts were buying and using EV's and showing the general public they were adaptable to real life and cool, they'd get their hands on them for reviews faster. Manufacturers need EV's to thrive and be adopted quickly (guessing they have little intrest in owning and operating multiple product line factories with completely incompatible parts), and giving them to enthusiastic people and not critics is the way to do that. After all, techies and the general public are their primary market. Id venture to say tech geeks are very realistic and practical people, which EV's work very well for. Manufacturers want these to go mainstream, and having people demonstrate how to best use them is perfect. Give it to a car reviewer and you'll get a bunch of \"this panel gap is larger than I'd like\" \"when I roadtrip across the country, like, every weekend, I have to stop for an extra 22 minutes every 2 hours which I don't have time for\" \"there are gas cars in this same class with more premium interiors for the money\" (ignoring the fact the EV's cost more to make) \"too many electronics, big brother is watching\" (ignoring that big brother is watching any car made in the last several years) And you'll get the occasional spewing if misinformation like \"this Prius is worse for the environment than my mustang GT\" which, while entertaining, does call the credibility of 'car guys' into question. Manufacturers aren't looking for car people to buy these. Car people buy stuff thats like 10 years old (we now have a plethora of brand new crossovers to pick from due to this) Manufacturer's bread and butter is '~10 year from retirement' white collar middle managers, and upscale soccer moms. Car review channels generate a large amount of traffic.....but when the majority of that traffic isnt old enough to drive, or doesn't have enough money to buy the reviewed car, it doesn't help manufacturers much.",

        "description": "I was recently employed to mystery shop KIA and well it was a very interesting experience. I arrived and like sharks to blood I was approached by two guys nearly simultaneously. It was like a battle to get the first word out and eye contact. One guy wins , let's call him Brandon and immediately asks me what I'm looking for. I say I'm here to look at a Stinger. We walk over to the Stinger, he starts talking about it. Nearly every fact he is saying is incorrect. Saying \"it's supercharged and turbo\" \"has a manual transmission\" (points to paddles)\", On top of that I can tell he is trying to connect with me claiming with some absurd statements \"This is faster than some supercars\" \"it has a BMW suspension\" \"they race these now\" \"i have a Charger and this is so much better\" (ok maybe that one is True) and then he switches to undermining my own vehicle. \" I bet your car now doesn't have navigation\" \"it won't beat this in a drag race\" \"girls will love this instead\" \"your car isn't that shiny does it need a paint job?\" \"Does your car do 160mph?\" At this point I just roll with it. He's a rookie perhaps. A massive douchy rookie, but a rookie none the less. I ask to test drive it. \"You're going to buy it if I pull it out right?\" \"I won't let people test these unless they are buyers\" . He's treating this Stinger like it's a Porsche GT3. I say \"I need to test drive it\" he asks for my keys (big mistake) and license. We go on a test drive and he won't stop talking. He tells me to pull over and he will drive us back (big mistake #2). He proceeds to mob it through 1st and 2nd gear, bouncing off the limiter even. We get back, I was supposed to end there, but I need my keys and license back. we head to his desk, At this point he goes all in , running numbers, asking what I want to pay a month. Next I ask for my keys back. \"Oh are you sure I was going to have our guys give you a trade in amount, let's start with your social\" I tell him I need the keys. \"I can only do that if you let me show you what I can do first\" now I realize my keys are hostage. I'm over it, I tell him dude I not buying a car, I'm working you. He doesn't give up. I ask for the manager, I show the manager my badge, he also looks annoyed as hell, starts telling me how I should rate them and I finally get my keys and license back. Here's the kicker, as I walk back to my car the sales guy he had someone move the Stinger behind my car blocking me in. Needless to say this all went into my report. If KIA plans on selling $40-50k Stingers they better up their sales staff, because I've had better sales experiences on Canal St in NYC.",

And it sort of makes sense if you think about it. For a majority of their existence, KIAs have been seen as the bottom of the barrel vehicle. And even though their quality has vastly improved in the last decade, that idea still persists. So quality sales people aren't drawn to work there selling lower cost cars and therefore making less commission, and with their long warranty master techs are excited to work there because a lot of what they're doing will be for book time which isn't as profitable as out of pocket. If they're really looking to compete with higher end brands like Audi and BMW, or really even Ford and Chevy, they definitely need to improve their dealer/service network.",

When Audi launched their comeback in North America in the 90's, they started the Audi Brand Specialist program.

Salespeople were compensated for this time (a rarity), so there was less push back than the usual unpaid training that takes place in a back room at the dealer. They learned customer psychology (identify the personality type and tailor the experience to suit them), product knowledge, competitor knowledge, etc. If someone wanted to just phone it in so to say, the dealer was asked to put forward someone else with more zeal. There was also a handsome quarterly bonus structure that rewarded not just units sold, but maintaining a high CSI as well. I know I was mystery shopped a few times.

It's a coating to prevent rust. And they have a flashing light or something that allegedly prevents rear-ending. You have to tell them to take it off. They weren't happy when came back the next day to remove $500+ worth of charges that they failed to explain. I had to Google everything. Not the best way to be \"Gephardt Approved\" out there.",

Anyway both the sales people and managers were acting like they were doing us a favor even showing us around so we just left. Didn't say anything to the staff I just told my wife I had enough of this condescending BS and she agreed so we both walked out. Ended up buying a TLX someone had traded in to a Lexus dealership. Those guys were great and treated us well. It was an older gentleman who helped us out and I couldn't believe how much better he was than the other dealership. We walked in and the first thing he does is introduce himself, shake both of our hands, offer us a drink and a snack, and then ASKED if we wanted him to walk us through the showroom or if we wanted to browse on our own.",

One of my best friends has purchased 2 Optimas in the last four years. I don't remember him saying anything negative about the sales experience. On his 2015 Optima he hit something metal on the freeway and it punctured the oil pan and blew the engine. His insurance only wanted to pay for a used engine, but the dealership stepped up and but a brand new engine in it so he was very happy with the service department.

                "comentario": "I'll start by saying thank you so much OP for posting this experience and getting the rants going! My SO and I purchased our first Kia Rio 5 in 2013 and have NEVER experienced a company worse than Kia when it comes to customer service. I am so glad I have this great opportunity to rant as well. Our nightmares NEED to be shared with the rest of you. As a prelude to the lengthy next bit that's about to come, I will say this; I want Kia to disappear! That's how terrible of a company they are. I will lay out as many of our bad experiences that I can remember in chronological order leading up to the very recent and most defining last one. 1. Bought our car in early January 2013. Financing option wasn't the issue at all. The car came with factory installed tint. A welcome touch (or so we thought). We also bought the extended bumper to bumper warranty (8y, 160k). 2. Within a month, the rear right bumper reflector lens falls out without any known impact. I take it in and am charged over $200 to replace. 3. A week later I am called by the dealer and asked to come in for an unscheduled minor recall issue. Turns out my car didn't come with the right floor matts. 4. A week or two later the aforementioned tint starts peeling off the driver window. I schedule an appointment to bring it in. They tell me the tint guy is outsourced and can only perform the service on Saturdays when they open (7 or 8 am). I get there only to find out the tint guy is late. I wait 2 hours and he never shows. The GM apologizes and tells me he will get the tint guy to come to my house and do the job outside. I doubted him right away (it was winter) but for some naive reason, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. 5. Later that week the dealership calls me to confirm my thoughts. The tint guy can only do it at the shop AND I still need to accommodate his schedule. I come in again and leave the car to get the tint done. 6. When the job is done I ask if all the windows were redone and am told there is no need. One of the salespeople says eight to me that that is BS and I should expect more tint to peel. The dealer still won't do anything unless something else peels. 7. Less than a month later 2 more windows start to peel. Also, the manual transmission seems to be making a weird sund when in low gears. 8. I bring the car in unscheduled on a weekend and while waiting for the dealer to bring my car in for service, the GM finds me and asks me why I'm there again. I bring him to the car to show him and he right away tells me I have a lemon or a bad luck car. He reminds me that I originally wanted the higher trim model (SX) and in black (I settled for some ugly orangey color). When I had originally purchased, those options weren't available but that day, the exact one I wanted was sitting on the lot new. 9. The GM gets me out of the old into the new the same day. This was my first/second car purchase and unfortunately I wasn't diligent enough when making the switch. I hadn't realized until it was pointed out to me a couple years later, that the GM had burried the negative equity off the trade in right into my financing agreement. 10. I ask the GM for a $500 gas card for everything I've been through and he agrees I deserve one but says there is nothing he can do about it and suggests I call Kia Canada (yes this was in Canada. A bigger hint is that it was in Ontario), and speak to the customer experience department. He even tells me to involve him and he will back me up. 11. I call Kia Canada and tell my story to the correct department. My case is instantly escalated to the head of this department. She and I spend days going back and forth arguing as she investigates the case. She eventually even acknowledges that the GM made the suggestion and stands by me but still says no. She and the GM start \"battling it out\" until the GM returns to me and says he can't help. Its basically out if his jurisdiction. He tells me to call back one final time and put up a real fight. 12. I call the head of the customer experience department for all of Canada and at this point she is so frustrated by our week long back and forth a that she ends it with a final......\"FUCK OFF!\". You read that right. The head of Kia Canada's customer experience department spewed those words out and put the nail in the coffin with that. 13. We decided to move on and just enjoy our new car. 14. About 8-9 months into ownership, one exteremly cold winter night after working outside for 8 hours (valet parking for an event), the car konks out about 1km from my house. I push it all the way to our driveway and use our seemingly fantastic warranty to have the vehicle towed to the dealer. To avoid going through the headaches we suffered with the last car, I have it towed to a different, much further dealer. Someone I knew who also owned a Kia and agreed the dealer I bought the car from stunk, said he'd had much better experience with this one. 15. I go to the dealer and find out that the yaw rate sensor and one other sensor were malfunctioning and not allowing the fuel to make it to the motor. They would have to be replaced but were not in stock. So now leaving the car this far away and not being able to come home with it the same day seemed stupid. So I had them bring it back to the original dealer to make my life easy. 16. Once it gets to the other dealer they indicate that the entire diagnosis needs to be done again because each dealer is independent and regardless of the results they share, it must be done by them. FINE! 17. Over the next few years I tried avoiding all dealerships for all regular maintenance and was pretty successful in doing so. However, eventually, I began to notice the fuel consumption increasing drastically. I tried 2 other Kia dealers in my area in my endeavour to find a good one and experienced the same crap eevrywhere. 18. As well, over the years I've had to replace the backup camera and entire NAV unit as they too became defective. 18. When it came to the fuel consumption issue, that battle was lost when the head mechanic showed me a chart created by Kia that showed that there was an acceptable range for fuel consumption and my car was still in it. The range was ridiculously huge and once again, Kia got their way. Today, I get an average of 330km to a tank. I barely drive it for the last 18 months though on the count of working from home since. 19. Fast forward to about 1 month ago. I went to my dealer because the transmission was slipping, the rear left caliper was leaking, and both shock bushings were worn and needed replacing. I found this out while getting a safety check which I obviously did not pass. If anyone is wondering, yes, I have been 1000% on top of all scheduled maintenance. As well, I thought to mention that both front seatbelts were no longer retracting and the drivers side door and gear shifters paint had been coming off over the years. I was hoping all this would be covered by my amazing warranty. 20. I come in for the diagnosis and they tell me that my warranty is 3rd party and not offered by Kia anymore. They aren't sure what it covers by they believe it is the best one and even better than their current warranties. The first thing they discover is that there is a $250 deductible per claim. So, to avoid having me make 2 separate claims, they indicate that the first plan of attack is to perform a transmission fluid flush to see if the slipping goes away. If after a week it seems okay, then they will put the claims in without the transmission. However, if after the flush nothing changes, they will submit with. 21. I show them the exact maintenance schedule I've been following that was provided to me by them when I first bought the car and point out that it does not indicate my car ever needs a flush. They say I'm actually about 40k km past due but it won't affect my warranty because I was in fact never told this is required. They charge me the usual dealer rip off rate to do something my car apparently didn't need. 22. The issue goes away and after a week of driving the car, I call the dealer back to tell them to file the claim without a transmission job. 23. The dealer gets back to me a week later and indicates that the caliper and shocks are covered but not the seatbelts or paint. Great warranty! If mine is one of the best, how does it get worse from here? 24. I bring the car in for the warranty work and this is where things get so sour, we posted a Yelp review about this experience. Now you get to hear about to too! This next experience was the deciding factor of whether or not we renew our loan agreement after maturity this April and enjoy the extended warranty until the km run out or buy something else.",

As a result, both are illuminated at the same time, so the lights can be too bright for other drivers, increasing the risk of a crash.

She didn't look back and kept going, so we had to swerve into a ditch at the last possible second. Car took a hard jolt leaving the road and we were unsure as to whether or not she had hit us. She never looked back and appeared to have no idea what happened despite constant horn. Unsure as to whether or not an accident had actually happened, we got back on the road, caught up - she was going about 15 in a 35 - and laid on the horn to get her to pull over and she never once looked back. I presume she was deaf. Called the cops when she wouldn't stop (and oddly, started looping back in the exact same direction she had come from), gave her plate numbers, and they came and took a report but told us there's literally nothing they would do about this. Also, if we swerved to avoid her reckless failure to yield and hit a tree, we would be liable, not her. Wonderful. About to buy a dash cam...",

So I suggest retesting for everyone. It'd work like this, assuming you're in a jurisdiction where the licensing age is 16 you obviously get tested then, and again at 18. I think the problem with our US System is you're thrown at the test before you have any real experience so in order for anyone to be licensed the standards are comically low. So still give that 16 year their own (possibly provisional) licence, but make them come back two years later and show they can do more than drive around the parking lot and parallel park. After that, restest *everyone* every five years (so 23, 28, 33, 33, etc). Even if you passed at 18 with flying colors, bad habits still sneak in and there's a lot of \"mature\" drivers who seem to forget how priority is assigned at a four way stop sign, or how to safely merge. Retesting ensures those rules stay fresh, making the roads safer for everyone. At 63 begin retesting every other year. Everyone accepts the fact that our bodies eventually aren't as good as they used to be, but we all also think it hasn't effected us too badly. So prove it, retest and prove you still got it. Failing a test you should have two choices, go without for three months until you can retest or go through an education course and retest immediately after passing the course. It'll suck, failing a test will have serious implications for people's lives and careers. But it won't suck nearly as much as dying in a car crash because someone doesn't know how to check their fucking blindspots.",

I also run [a second YouTube Channel about cars](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG72WbiCvdB6JKU-3YRP8Kg), and I'm the founder of [Cars & Bids](https://carsandbids.com/), a new auction platform for enthusiast cars from the modern era that's been quickly growing in popularity. I love r/cars, I pass many an hour here, and I last did an AMA three years ago (to the exact day, which I didn't plan and only just realized) -- so I figured it was time for another. In addition to my channels and Cars & Bids, I've also owned a host of weird and cool cars (Mercedes G500 Cabriolet, Audi RS2, Dodge Viper GTS, Ford GT, Nissan S-Cargo) and I deeply love Gilmore Girls, Washington DC, and wearing multiple t-shirts. So, ask me anything! **EDIT** OK, I tried to answer as much as I possibly could, and now I've got to get back to work! Thank you so much to everyone for participating -- this was fun! I'll be sure to be back before another three years passes :)",

OK, so-and-so did a cool video, why didn't I think of that?\" Same with Cars & Bids -- a lot of people tell me they go on to check it out and see the auctions close and what cool cars have been listed today. I go on and think \"Oh, I wish we had better photos of that car... oh I hope that hits reserve\" etc. But I enjoy working, and it's a cool job, so it's OK! > When is the \"offroading in my Defender\" video coming?

Also, it's beautiful, it has incredible restaurants, and it has truly empty beaches even during the most perfect summer days. And as much as I live California, there's nothing like an East Coast summer where people truly appreciate it because they know it's fleeting. Nantucket also has an *AMAZING* old-school SUV culture, and I love seeing all the cool stuff that shows up every summer. Every single street reveals a new Defender, Land Cruiser, grey market G-Wagen, whatever. It's insane.",

There is the occasional cameo from Noodle on More Doug, but in general you've been really good about keeping your private life, well, private. It seems you've made a conscious choice to separate your business and personal life. Has it been difficult to maintain that separation. **Is there content you would have covered (like a more detailed version of your Defender road trip) that would have been difficult, because of the privacy for family/friends?** You also don't seem to collaborate much outside of your channel with friends in the industry. The few exceptions are the TST podcast, reviewing Jay Leno's McLaren F1, and that series with Hoovie for on the AutoTrader channel (that was kinda funny, but I don't expect that to see a \"season 2\" of that show). **Have you been approached to be more active in the wider car enthusiast community (American Top Gear, cross-channel collaborations, etc)?**",

Now that I'm here, I can film virtually every single video locally, so it's a lot easier to manage time. I've also started delegating things where necessary. I hired an assistant two years ago, and last year I finally hired a video editor (which I should've done sooner). Of course, Cars & Bids has several employees to manage everything.

Ford won't tell me where it is, or when it will be delivered. I've written a summary I'm hoping to get noticed here: https://medium.com/@comradeflynn/the-nightmare-of-buying-a-ford-focus-rs-90a94ebca48d#.hq1qywwzw EDIT for a couple of points. I'm not going to get a lawyer involved or sue. It's just not worth the effort. I half want to walk away, but I've only got a month until my race that I desperately want to go to, and this may be the quickest option if they actually found it. I don't blame my dealer and I don't think the car was sold off. I've had people look it up in the tracking system and it just shows IN TRASIT infinintely. I'm mostly mad because I just really want the car. Seeing people getting theirs when they ordered 6+ months after me is frustrating. Some people have had theirs for almost 2 months now. Oh, and finally, I actually had applied to get on the GT list. I'm going to assume THAT won't be happening now!",

I had one girl who was picky as could be (every right to be on a 30k purchase) -We built her a suv on the computer. -We then had ford production make her car. -she left and had to wait 6 weeks (pretty standard) However, when she called to get her car and the price, I assume to haggle, my store wouldn't allow me to tell her the price or location. The reasoning, according to my management was we didn't do negotiations over the phone to save profit in the car. Just an interesting story. P.s. I can tell you the best way to buy a car is... Do not wait to negotiate. We were there to make commission and we would take a mini (the lowest commission) to put a deal together. My advice is to research the car you want thoroughly on the web. Come into the dealership, find the youngest guy and tell them you have x money down, x credit score and you are willing to buy right now (be serious if you are) the car of interest if they show you the lowest price on the computer in the managers office. Then say \"if I feel like I'm being swindled at any point, I'm walking out that door. Do you want a deal or not?\" I saw 3 customers do this and we knocked off all profit except the bare minimum we had to make money every time. Be firm and negotiate before you even drive the car.",

I'm not sure it's a \"mistake.\" It can take a long time to pre-order a brand new car that comes from another continent - that's why automakers don't give guarantees. The dealer may have, but the dealer isn't Ford and doesn't build the car. The cars aren't transported by Ford either, they're all transported by third-party companies. They don't have GPS in them - Ford is relying on the transportation companies to tell them where the car is. Ford doesn't have eyes on your car, they can't tell you specifically where it is. Additionally, it is super common for vehicles to need modifications at their port of entry - installation of US specific parts, labels, etc. This is also done by a third party company, which may or may not be a pro at this, which may take time. There is no guarantee how long this process takes, so again, they don't give you a guarantee. It's also worth noting that he doesn't buy his car from \"Ford\" so there would be no reason to \"lawyer up\" against Ford. He is buying his car from a dealership that has ordered it from Ford - Ford doesn't guarantee the dealership any delivery window for orders.",

                "comentario": "This take is utterly terrible, especially for a respected publication like Road and Track. &#x200B; Completely irresponsible for a respected magazine like Road and Track to not even fact check the graph the Author himself linked. For instance, the author claimed that average house prices have gone up from $79,100 in 1990 to $325,000 today. [While linking this graph as a source.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSPUS) &#x200B; Except if you can read the graph, in Q1 1990 the median house price is $123,900...... &#x200B; Edit: Ok, so let's dig into the numbers shall we? The author claims that cheap sports cars are dead because young people cannot afford them, and that enthusiast vehicles are disappearing. &#x200B; Let's look at expensive sports cars for a minute shall we? &#x200B; Let's start by examining the numbers of the Cadillac Allante. The uber expensive flagship Cadillac sports car that was the butt of all the jokes for being a huge flop in the 80s and 90s. Over 7 model years, Cadillac sold a total of 21,430 of them in the United States. &#x200B; The Lexus LC sold 5,682 in its first three model years. If we assume a constant average number of sales, you're looking at an extrapolated 13,258 sales over 7 years. Jaguar's F-type, by all means a sales success, barely exceeded the Cadillac at 23,715 over 7 years. Audi's TT? over the last 7 years it sold 12,329. Hell, Acura NSX sales are down significantly, the new NSX cannot even crack 300 units last year. &#x200B; So the flop that was the butt of all the jokes back then actually would be considered a sales success by modern standards. Expensive sports car sales are pitiful. If the author's thesis is that cheap sports cars are dead because young people cannot afford them, then why did the expensive sports car market also implode? &#x200B; Now let's look at the other side of the market. The author claims that \"enthusiast car sales\" are down, be he's blatantly wrong. Jeep Wrangler's sales numbers peaked in 2018, at 240,032. In 1990, Jeep sold less than 50 thousand of them. Toyota 4 runner sales also peaked in 2018, at 139,694 units. When it came out in 1994, Toyota sold 74 thousand of them. &#x200B; Sports cars in general are a shrinking segment. Even the expensive ones appealing to rich people (note: arguably you can even say that expensive sports cars should do better due to income inequality) are doing terrible. &#x200B; While on the other hand, Jeep Wranglers, 4 runners, Defenders, and all the off-road enthusiast cars are selling great. &#x200B; Remember, up until this weird 2020, the car market as a whole has been very strong. Sales have been at or near all time high levels for many years in a row now, and average sale prices have only been going up. &#x200B; In a time when overall car sales are strong and offroader sales are also strong, I hesitate to blame terrible sports car sales on the fact that young people aren't flush with cash. After all, expensive sports cars sales are also really, really down. &#x200B; Maybe the easiest way to look at it is just that tastes have changed, and that despite the fact that the car market is extremely strong, people just don't want coupes anymore. &#x200B; PS: want another data point? Last year, GLS class sold nearly double what the S class sold, and the S coupe/convertible sold so bad, they got axed for this year. The S class obviously appeals to very financially secure buyers. Even wealthy buyers who likely own multiple cars don't care for coupes anymore.",

F150 sales have increased from 495,977 to 896.526. Ram went from 87,978 to 633,694. Silverado from 464,668 to 575,603. Sierra is up to 232.323 (I don't have 1990 numbers) In that same time the top F-150 MSRP went from $14,933 to $71,160. In 1990, there were 773.4 cars per 1000 people. By 2016 it was up to 831.9 cars per 1000 people. Currently, more people than ever have cars. And those cars are more expensive than ever. If they wanted sports cars, they could afford them. Problem is now it can cost over a billion to design a car. In the 1990s, the cheap fun cars were based on, or shared parts with, the regular cars. Take the Fox Body Mustang for example, the platform was used by 17 cars. That's a lot cars to split the R&D across. Now Ford doesn't have any cars except the Mustang. So the next Mustang has to share a platform with an SUV -- that's not an ideal way to make a cheap, fun, car. Other companies don't have platforms to share to make sports cars. The other issue is that the performance of regular cars go too good. If a Camry can do 0-60 in 5.8s, what's the point of buying a sports car? A Miata or BRZ is slower. If you want better performance than a 'regular' car, you need to spend a shit ton of money.",

The infant car seat made it nearly impossible for me, 6'2\", to sit with it behind me. If we were in the Renegade, the infant car seat needed to be behind my 5'5\" wife, and even then, her knees nearly touched the glovebox. Not to mention that strollers barely fit in the back. If we needed to take the dog and a stroller, something was staying at home. I used to think it was silly, but now I totally understand why families with only two kids have three-row vehicles.

The prices are often way over 3rd party listing sites advertising the same or similar cars. A car can look great in a BaT listing and bring Top Dollar and only after you get it delivered do you realize, \"shit, I wish I could have test driven this\" May not even be the old owners fault.

Like in another comment I am currently watching the 2014 Porsche 911 Turbo market for when it makes sense to trade in my Supra. GTRs are another car I would consider used! Besides that...I'll just keep my Supra. It's modified anyway lol. I had it tuned and Downpiped with 7k in audio upgrades (Subs, custom box, amp, and aftermarket speakers) so I don't mind waiting since I sunk a bit of money into this one. Usually trade in and get another car every 18-24 months and I've been itching to do it lol!",

A Prelude Si started a few hundred dollars more than that, and the 4 wheel steering model went up to like $19,000. It was the upgraded model with like 140hp. The 300ZX turbo of the same year was like $36,000.

In fact, ICE cars are 10 times more likely to catch on fire than electric cars, on a per miles driven basis. https://insideevs.com/news/501729/number-tesla-vehicle-fires-2020/ (yes it's an EV centric site, but the data it cites is not) Basically, an electric car will normally only catch on fire in the event of a major collision, puncturing of the battery pack, or in very rare cases catch on fire while charging (which is often the fault of the house's wiring, not the car itself). Meanwhile, a gas car can catch on fire because a fuel or oil line decides to leak at the wrong time and splash a flammable liquid all over a hot engine part. It's a significantly easier failure path.",

Most other automakers use radar-based systems, with computer vision being a secondary input. My personal vehicle has twin rear-firing radars for just the self parking and blind spot monitoring systems. All the other highway assistance systems I know of have several front and rear firing radar modules, typically at least a short range at every corner and a forward-firing long range unit. Most other OEMs are approaching city street driving with at least some degree of reliance on lidar on top of that.",

                "comentario": "Depending on the car, that's a lot of money lost to convenience. We buy used and sell used privately. 5 years ago when I sold my car and bought the replacement car, we kept $15,000 between the sale of our old car and purchase of our \"new\" used car relative to what we we offered by CarMax and dealerships for the first car and what CarMax and dealerships were selling the second car for. Our most recent exchange, we kept about $5000-7000. All through Craigslist or Facebook marketplace. Sure it takes time and patience. It usually takes me 3-6 weeks to sell my car and similar to find a car I want to buy. I maybe spend 15 minutes per night when I'm looking to buy (15 mins x 6 weeks is about 11 hrs). When I'm selling I spend maybe 5 minutes per night checking Facebook marketplace or responding to emails. I make people come to me to test drive and I meet close to my house for a test drive, within 10 minutes. I probably get burned 1-2 times when selling and it costs me 30 minutes. So (5 mins x 6 weeks is about 4 hrs. Add in 2 hrs of waiting around without someone showing. That's 6 hrs). I'll be even more conservative. Let's say I spend 25 hrs buying with test drives factored in and 10 hours on the selling end. $5000/35 hrs is $142 per hour. I highly doubt most of the people selling to CarMax etc make more than $142 per hour at their jobs. It's amazing what people will give up financially for convenience.",

The companies that are truly competing with Bugatti these days for the top speed record are all extremely low volume. Koenigsegg, Hennessey, SSC, etc. Of those, Koenigsegg is the largest by a lot and they've still only produced a few hundred cars in their entire history. AFAIK there are more Chirons on the road right now than the total number of Koenigseggs ever made from the CC through today, and that will not change even when the Regera and Jesko production runs are complete. These are companies that make expensive cars, but they're not operating on enormous profit margins. The substantial R&D costs have to be rolled in to a few dozen to maybe a few hundred cars, where VW can basically consider the entire Bugatti brand a loss leader. Their engineers get to play at the bleeding edge and some of that will probably turn out to be useful for their more mainstream vehicles. If another one of the big names decided they wanted to play, they could probably set up a comparable track pretty easily, but so far none of them have shown any real interest.",

More allegations abound, but these are the ones I most remember seeing a few years ago when they sprung up. I read enough to know that I wouldn't trust them with my car, so I stopped caring so more information may have come out since then.

But a car in production spec needs to make a pass in each direction before it gets the title of fastest car. This is impressive, and I'm sure that W16 has plenty of room left for tuning, but this is little more than a test mule making a proof of concept pass.",
