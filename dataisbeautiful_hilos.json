So Im guessing theres some idea of background or ground state and then a change in that.

We nearly canceled our anniversary trip in late February but decided that we were mostly going to be inside our hotel room. Once we got there, I kept seeing more news about possible outbreaks and we did cancel the second night, driving the hour back home. It felt like I was going insane when so much of the US, and many of my friends, talked about this coming out of nowhere and how the alarm should have been raised earlier.

If you like it, give it a chance. Dont take a random redditors opinion as a heavy baseline for how the season is. Need to form your own opinion. I usually take others opinions with a grain of salt going into something. To give an example, I gave TWD a season and 3 episodes before giving up on it. Longest I have ever given a show before giving up. Breaking bad I gave 6 episodes. Couldnt get into either, but look how successful both became. Dont trust my opinion. Thats all Im saying Edit Thank you for the award. Also, thank you everyone for the replies. I thought this comment would get downvoted to hell, but the replies have given me so much closure for those two shows.

Even with something like the George Floyd protests you dont see it being at the top for very long, because reasonably you can probably google him once to get a video and synopsis of what happened, and once when the dust settled. Everything on the news cycles in between is largely clickbait. Basically what Im saying is this metric is predisposed to not having one topic be at the top for very long, even if it is ongoing in the public consciousness. I will say the sheer amount of pop cultureentertainment that hits the top had me blinking  but its the same sort of thing. Theres so much many interests in our society, it probably doesnt take a big spike to beat out the noise. What Id be really interested in is taking this same data for any individual state, or for the nation and showing an animated bar graph or something. I have a hunch for most of these spikes were not talking about a majority, were talking about a narrow plurality. Something like George Floyd probably represents a big short spike, and something like the weekend probably represents a small spike beating out the search noise when nothing big is going on. At least, thats my hypothesis. Keep in mind, these sorts of charts are usually just measuring noise when nothing big is happening. Semirelevant xkcd  though I dont this particular example is just amplifying noise, its worth keeping in mind, its also worth keeping in mind that just because something is showing up doesnt necessarily mean more than a couple percent of the google searches were for that thing.",

OP pulled data from Googles trending searches, and we dont know what algorithm Google is using to figure out what is trending. But generally speaking its going to care about spikes in searches more than number of searches. Of example, Ive never heard of bubba wallace. Couldnt tell you if its a music artist or a character in a TV show. And yet Google trends claims that Bubba wallace is a more popular term than Cornavirus in every state. But that makes sense, because theres a sharp spike in bubba wallace searches that week, whereas by that time coronavirus searches have leveled out. Comparison So then the reason that not all states have coronavirus trending at the same time is that not all states were first effected at the same time. California stands an outlier in later graphs where coronavirus isnt showing up, but I think thats because searches have leveled off for CA by that time, not because people arent searching for it. So having people aware and searching for something earlier actually hurts your stats because you would have a more gradual slope up.",

Terry is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Terry, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Terry, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Terry is the kernel the program in the system that allocates the machines resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Terry is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system the whole system is basically GNU with Terry added, or GNUTerry. All the socalled Terry distributions are really distributions of GNUTerry.",

While America operates on fptp nationally, we also have electoral college where there is little to no risk voting third party in a state where your party has little chance. For instance, I live in Delaware where all news networks would call a safe Democrat state. While Republicans have a following, they are extremely unlikely to win. If I were a conservative moderate and I didnt like the policy of the Democrat party but dont quite agree with the Republican Party, there is no risk in voting third party. In popular vote, this is very much the case but in an electoral college system, there are around 25 states where the state is not mandated to give their electoral vote to the more popular party in their state 2. Voter turnout is low enough in every state that the president is usually decided by something like 13 or 25 of the countrys population. In the jungle theoretical, 100 were voting every year. In the US we rarely go higher than 60 3. The only guarantee of a third party failing is a collective belief in the spoiler effect which is real but the only way to stop a third party voter from voting that way is to convince them their vote is wasted and hurting political allies. Henceforth, both parties want everyone to believe that a third party vote is a vote for the other party because it threatens their power when people vote independently.",

The charcoal embers burn slowly enough with existing vegetation to stay alive over the winter, and fire crews have to make aerial surveys, looking for steam or smoke to manually extinguish these remaining patches. Forest fires are no different than your camping fire. You keep putting water or snow on them until they are cold, not just visibly flaming.",

I keep gardens and aquariums  thats not a lot of material, and ash isnt really that potent. I am assuming most of the material from a fire ends up vaporized in our atmosphere or falling as ash near the fire. Given the average depth and buffering capacity of the ocean I really doubt it would have an immediate, direct effect on the ocean. I could see that perhaps it might encourage some algal blooms. I dont know about the ocean specifically but a small change in nutrient density in the uppermost layer of water is all some life needs to explode. Still, I doubt the smoke would in any way rival what we induce with agricultural runoff.",

There arent enough masks to go around and most people are just staying indoors. Its not ideal but its about all we can do. Today is going to be 42 degrees and thats going to be a problem as we need to keep doors and windows shut to keep the smoke out, as well as not running our evaporative cooler which draws air in from outside. We might end up going somewhere with air conditioning just for some respite. More alarmingly, today will bring very dangerous bushfire conditions. Super hot, high winds, plenty of dry material ready to burn. There safe thankfully no fires on our doorstep theres one 100km away that is a bit of a concern, but Canberra is surrounded by bush so if anything starts, that will be a problem. On top of that, three small fires have started near my neighbourhood in the last few days and theres a good chance they were deliberately lit.

So if you left the sun moving at the speed of light and then slowed down to normal speeds when you got to Earth, it would seem like the trip was instantaneous whereas everyone else saw it take you roughly eight minutes to leave the sun. Same goes for Jupiter, it would seem like no time had passed since you left the sun, but everyone else would see it taking you fortysomething minutes to get out there. So when traveling at the speed of light, time is no longer a good indicator as to the amount of distance you are currently traveling. You can only notice the distance that you have traveled once you slow down. EDIT Also want to point out that matter traveling at the speed of light is unequivocally not possible as we understand it, so definitely interesting thing to think about, but dont read too much into it.",

But they do take into account time and length dilation, so traveling near the speed of light, the universe contracts, and within your lifetime, you can reach your target destination. But, relatively, tens of thousands of years will have passed in the reference frame of your destination when you get there. If you were at war when you left, whats the appropriate response once you arrive? Whos to say that the people you wanted to fight are still in power once you arrive, or if their species even exists anymore?

It takes about a year to reach very close to the speed of light at 1 g acceleration for the outside observer so the difference between a 1 g round trip and a photon flying at the speed of light constantly for the whole trip is negligible over those distances. 46 600 000 000 years or 46 600 000 005 years doesnt really matter.

That being said, objects when approaching speed of light experience lesser time than when at rest. So what happens when something attains light speed? The object is moving at light speed through the spatial dimensions i.e., all of its speed devoted only for its motion through Space and there is no motion through time. This means that time does not exist for objects travelling at the speed of light. Hence, your answer. Objects travelling at speed of light do not experience time. Which is to say, from their perspective, they travel at infinite speed. They can travel huge distances in literally no time. They dont age, since they dont travel through time at all. Tldr Yes. When travelling at the speed of light, ones perception of time would be instantaneous. He would not experience time at all. Its difficult to ponder upon what it would feel like, since were used to time. Time is something so known to us that we cannot even imagine of any reality without it.",

These are the things that people want to read about and the order with which any journalist will place a story in terms of importance on any given day. Note the timely criteria, which is the one most likely to influence these results since it depends on how often something happens. Not much new happens with cancer. The more timely news there is about cancer, the more likely it is to receive coverage. Compare to terrorism, which has frequent new developments. So terrorism gets more headlines by default than cancer. Cancer is always killing and you only really talk about it when it impacts people in a new way, maybe from the perspective of prominence, like when a celebrity gets it. Or if theres a cure developed that has both impact and timeliness. Terrorism is shocking and new by its very nature. If we had a sudden burst of explosive cancer, it would receive so much coverage you wouldnt even know what to do about it. Itd drive you crazy.",

Eg a woman dying at 40 40 years too early is more than 8x as bad as a woman dying at 75 5 years too early.

Sadly most of the lowest scoring countries are more likely to have religious taboos than adequate care. The guns make it too easy. I would be surprised if there was much debate about that among those whove had suicidal thoughts or more. The silence is at least as deadly. Edit Clarification  the issue is not the amount of coverage or the public awareness of the deaths. The problem is that all thats talked about is the death. Its like if all we ever talked about was car crashes but never how to drive or what makes vehicles safe. We see the need to help people to be safe for themselves and others. Suicides do tremendous harm to not only the victims but all those around them, sometimes fatal harm. Its very much like a car crash but there are no classes, few advocacy groups and little conversation.

If you add 3.3 million unemployed people there, that makes the unemployment rate would be 5.5. Adding the couple weeks prior where unemployment claims also occurred at a more normal rate and you can push it to 6. Now, thats not totally proper, because it assumes zero new jobs during this time  and theres certainly people hiring. Supermarkets for example. But as a first approximation, thats probably about right. Note that theres still a time lag in these statistics, and this could be getting worse day by day.",

Shortly after this I ended up as a casualty of a position that was eliminated. Took 2 years to find another position after that and was happy to do anything at that point. Wharton Business School now agrees with this new way and glad management is willing to give it a try. The cost of rebuilding staff is far greater than the monetary value we place upon it. Hopefully others will feel this way too and it will make this transition a little easier for everyone. Good luck and godspeed on our journey.",

They had two main problems. First, they were part of Viacom who spun them off in 2003. They stripped everything valuable out of it and sent it off with an unserviceable amount of debt. Second, there was an incredible fear of failure culture within upper and middle management. It was better to not take chances and to let someone else screw up than it was to actually innovate. Things were changing, but no one at Blockbuster wanted to take the chance to adapt. Netflix had DVD subscription, and even in 2004, it was clear someone was going to develop streaming. Blockbuster had no plans for that. They basically said, We can add subscription! and built a dozen warehouses to do what Netflix was already doing very well. The combination of huge debt plus inability to take chances or plan for the future killed them. x200B EDIT spelling misteak",

The Netflix call center was rather chill at first, but there was a new head almost every 6 months, and eventually number crunch set in and there was extreme pressure to reduce customer compensation while improving customer satisfaction numbers, which put the squeeze on the people on the phones. Customers would be sent a survey after the call and theyd ask if they were happy with the service, and if they said No, it was a ding against the rep, even if the customer noted in their comments it was not the fault of the person they spoke with. Mostly they would burn you out after 6 months and then fire you. The housing recession in 2008 just made the place even more of a pressure cooker.",

A 2 day rental was expensive, it contained a lot of late fees even if you returned a movie on Monday morning a policy they didnt adjust until the mid 2000s, they didnt carry a good selection of foreign movies and other niche genres. They also werent good to their employees and were always looking to give people late fees and other nonsense like you said. There is a reason that once people had better options Redbox and Netflix and then streaming that people dropped BlockBuster quickly.

I think because the majority of the shift is in code and software as opposed to hardwaremetalbrick  mortar the rate of change might be seen at an unprecedented level which would bring unprecedented results.

Theyre throwing a lot of money at content but that wont guarantee success. They have higher debt to equity than Comcast, ATT, and Viacom although Comcast  ATT are harder to compare since they have telecom businesses that probably are the majority of the assets  income. So a lot of the funding is borrowed money I didnt bother looking up Disney since theyre probably streets ahead of the rest of the industry. Disney, NBC, Universal, CBS, HBO, WB, Paramount, MTV, Comedy Central all have decades of Movie  TV properties to cash in on while Netflix doesnt. This ties back to the point above Viacom can use money from Big Bang Theory syndication and Dreamworks movie releases to pay for content while Netflix will have to borrow it. Im fairly pessimistic Netflix personally, I just dont think all the spending now will payoff before they get too far in debt, but time will tell.",

Higher resolution cant hurt though.  It was a little hard to reference the monthday while also looking at the world plot.

In fact, I have bought a battery in years. Because its a little known fact that alkaline batteries can be recharged. I have never witnessed a battery exploding.....myth? The worst thing that can happen AFAIK is a black goo will leak...that is when its time to toss the battery. On average I can recharge an alkaline battery about 6 to 10 times before trashing.

Its possible real Panasonic batteries just came in last though too! Also, flashlights arent the best testing methodology for determining overall capacity. Tungsten fillaments will draw different amounts of current depending on the batterys internal resistance and voltage under load. A brighter flashlight that runs for 2 hours is sometimes seen as more useful than a dim one that runs for 6. If they used LEDs instead then maybe that levels the playing field. For example, NiMH rechargable batteries have a low internal resistance so you can cycle a camera flash faster than with a alkaline battery even though the alkaline battery can make it flash more times overall since it has more energy capacity.",

A Duracell from Walmart is typically grade D, whereas a Duracell from an actual battery store or even electronics store is going to typically be at least a grade B.

In math, we always learn the XY plane first, so Z is almost always depicted as it is shown in Maya.

A lack of winterization on their power plants and fuel inputs led to entire power plants shutting down due to the cold. Then there wasnt enough electricity to meet the demand, which was higher than usual because of the cold weather. So they planned rolling blackouts, but instead ended up just cutting power for days, even to residential areas. A lot of people died.. And look, people were going to die anyway in that weather  you cant fix all of that. But the issues they had were easily predictable and in fact had happened before, about 10 years ago, but they didnt do anything to fix it. And then when it happened this year, their politicians blamed wind power, which was one of the things that was unaffected and in fact increased output during the storm, making it seem incredibly unlikely that they intend to do anything about it now, either. So these things will just keep happening.. Only in Texas, though, because they insist upon having their own grid to avoid federal regulation. Im not an expert, but I think either the diversification and geographical spread of a large power grid or those pesky federal regulations themselves likely would have prevented this from being the major disaster it was.",

If I understand correctly this is based only on those topics that showed up as trending searches for the entire country. So when it says Elon Musk on Texas 20 Dec, that does not necessarily mean that Elon Musk was the most googled topic in Texas that day. It only means that of the limited number of topics that trended nationally during the year, Texans googled Elon Musk the most that day. Otherwise there would probably be many more statespecific searches showing up. tldr The graphic, while neat, gives the impression that the states have much more common interests than what probably is the case.",

Also, the scatterplot includes total count on the xaxis, so you can sort of mentally adjust for that. e.g. you can look at a column of affixes with approximately equal total frequency shit, fuck, dick, dog, dip and see major differences in their log sum i.e. product, which are certainly meaningful, even if youre more skeptical of comparing the products for affixes with different totals.",

None of it made sense and it was all one line broken up points. One of the disagreements was how they werent doing their part of the agreed household chores. Like how they left dishes in the sink until it was my turn to do them and by then it was fucking gross. Im usually away for work and get home and do them, which are my days, theyre usually at home but they do work a normal job as well so thats why we split things up. My ex conveniently forgot to mention that I wasnt home to do said chores when they werent being done. So of course people were like Omg dump them! Why wouldnt they do the dishes for youuuuu??? Why would they let it just sit thereeeeeee?!?? Emojiemojiemoji Needless to say when I left my ex was all Why are you leaving? You never tried to make it work! I at least tried to get councilling for us. That last line really fucking got me. I suggested going to a real fucking professional but that was too expensive and we dont have time for it and I want to spend time with you when youre home not at some strangers office.

There is a lot of bias going on on that subreddit, in my experience. Id say in most cases it could be about how the respective posts were written, but a friend of mine made a little experiment on this, used two different accounts to post the exact same thing from a womens and a mans perspective about 3 months apart. I am not sure what the accounts he used were called since they were throwaways but Ill try to find it and if I do Ill edit this post with the links. What I do know though is that the theme of the posts was about whether he was the asshole in a hypothetical situation where heshe and hisher boyfriendgirlfriend was being lazy with housework and an argument got out of control and heshe yelled at hisher SO. On the male post he got accused of obviously leaving out a lot of detail in the discussion he did leave a lot of holes in the story on purpose, and he was the asshole for pressuring the girlfriend into doing more housework than he does, whereas on the female post it was the boyfriend being the asshole for being lazy, eventhough it was the exact same post bar the swapped genders. Obviously none of this takes away from your arguments. There can be tons of different factors influencing the decisions of the respective people. I just think it can be a little sus sometimes.",
